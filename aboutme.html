<div class="page">
  <p>This site began when I wrote about taking baking classes at George Brown College.</p>
  <p>My love of baking began as a little boy, helping my Mom in the kitchen. Now, my son <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfQJCSHVGo&list=UUqjdPEU5SLN8hNAQQ_Lw6lQ">likes to bake too</a>.</p>
  <p>I try to never make the same thing twice.</p>
  <p>I currently live in Toronto, Canada with my wife, son and daughter.</p>
  <p>By day, I am a mobile developer at <a href="http://shopify.com/mobile">Shopify</a>. I've worked previously
  at Zynga, Five Mobile, RIM and Certicom.</p>
