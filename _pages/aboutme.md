This site began in 2005 when I wrote about [taking baking classes](/gbc) at George Brown College.

My love of baking began as a little boy, helping my Mom in the kitchen.
Now, my son [likes to bake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfQJCSHVGo) and
my [daughter too](https://flickr.com/photos/gnuf/50788735287/).

I try to never make the same thing twice. 

There are {{site.tags.muffins.size}} posts about [muffins](/tag/muffins) on this blog.

I currently live in Toronto, Canada with my wife, son and daughter.

By day, I am a data scientist at [Shopify](https://shopify.com/)
in Toronto, Canada. I've worked previously at Zynga, Five Mobile, RIM and Certicom.

Read about how this site is built in the [colophon](/colophon/).
