excerpt: "We went strawberry picking on the weekend, and after making a batch of jam, still had lots of fruit leftover. I decided to try making something simple for a first recipe from this book. The sorbet was easy enough, as was the balsamic syrup and mascarpone cream (mascarpone, milk, vanilla, lemon zest)."

I decided to try making something simple for a first recipe from this book. The sorbet was easy enough, as was the balsamic syrup and mascarpone cream (mascarpone, milk, vanilla, lemon zest). Assembly wasn't too difficult either, just a few grinds of black pepper on halved berries, then a spoonful of cream, a sccop of sorbet and then a drizzle of syrup. The strawberry-balsamic combination is well known by now, and this is a nice dessert to feature it. I would have wanted a little bit of sweetness in the mascarpone though.
