Mother's Day at our house, is often a breakfast-in-bed affair. This year,
we decided to change things up from the usual pancakes or waffles, and make
scones.

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/03/lemon-blueberry-scones-vegan-recipe.html) 
is by Stella Parks and it turns out it's *vegan*. Instead of cream or butter
which are the typical fat in scones, it uses refined coconut oil and coconut milk.
Aside from needing to use a food processor, the whole thing comes together
in ten minutes, plus a mandatory 15 minute chilling period.

I didn't taste any "coconut" flavour from these, just delicious lemon-blueberry
aromas. They're moist and tender. Certainly a lot less effort than having to
freeze and grate butter like the Cook's Illustrated [blueberry scones](/2007/06/blueberry-scones.html).
