The mess and unhealthiness of deep-frying make it a special occasion
occurrence at our house. For my son's birthday, we ended up making
churros, an easy fried treat that could be dipped in chocolate sauce.

The [recipe](https://www.thirteen.org/blog-post/recipe-cal-churros/) is 
from the Feb 2016 issue of Cook's Country (Season 10, if you watch on
the tube). I've made choux pastry and churros before, so the batter
isn't foreign to me. What was novel, is pre-piping the lengths all at 
once, rather than directly into the hot oil. This makes the process
safer and faster.

After a 15 minute spell in the fridge to firm them up, I started
frying. The batter was quite sticky, so I was glad for the heavily
sprayed parchment, as well as wetting my fingertips before picking
up the dough lengths. 

Because they sat on a sheet pan, one side of each churro was flat.
I think that's a small price to pay in aesthetics, compared with
the gain in simplicity. It didn't take long to cook all of them:
under a half hour for the three batches.

Straight out of the fryer, these were pretty crisp and delicious. I
don't remember whether I put vanilla in the batter or not, but
they were pretty tasteless on their own. Of course, these churros
aren't meant to be eaten plain. A roll in cinnamon sugar and a dunk
in warm chocolate ganache make them a satisfying three-bite dessert.
