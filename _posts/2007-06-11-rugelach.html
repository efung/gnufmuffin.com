What to make? Why rugelach, of course! The sugar-free dough is extremely easy to make in the food processor and rolls out easily. I spread the dough with açaí jam: it doesn't taste all that interesting to me, so I was glad to be able to use some of the jar up. These cookies were very tasty, featuring a rich, tender dough, and a yummy filling. Since they're small, it doesn't seem all that fattening to eat one (or two).
