I wanted to make a dessert featuring mangoes but in this case, I was not impressed by this recipe at all. The first problem is that cooking the fruit did not seem to enhance it in any way. Either that, or I didn't use ripe enough mangoes. Secondly, the fibrous matter was not strained out, so the texture of the pudding was quite grainy. I also incorporated a bit of yogurt which might explain the texture as well. Finally, I may have used too many gelatin sheets leading to a firmer pudding.<br /><br />Despite all my alterations and sub-optimal compromises, I don't think this is a good mango pudding recipe and won't make it again.
