Isn't natural bran available everywhere? Or is it that I know where to look and can purchase it easily? Anyway, I finally decided to try making these bran muffins for research purposes (much in the way that I'm always trying new <a href="/search?q=banana+bread">banana bread</a> recipes).<br /><br />Armed with a box of cereal and this recipe, I only made two changes. One, instead of grinding half the cereal until ground, I used an equivalent amount by weight of regular natural bran. Also, I used two whole eggs. The muffins turned out with crunchy tops, spongy texture and an unremarkable flavour. I don't think they would have been much improved had I followed the CI recipe to a T. It's definitely not worth it to buy a box of cereal to make these, especially if natural bran is a staple in your household (like it is in mine).
