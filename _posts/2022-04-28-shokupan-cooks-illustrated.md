I didn't grow up eating white Wonder bread: my family got 60% whole
wheat, or even 100% whole wheat. At Hong Kong bakeries, we would get
pineapple buns, cocktail buns, or Swiss rolls, but would never buy
the loaves of sandwich bread. So seeing milk bread, sliced into angular
square slices is somewhat of a novelty to me. 

The Guardian [calls it](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jun/06/shokupan-is-the-anti-sourdough-the-rise-of-japanese-milk-bread) "the anti-sourdough" and now Cook's Illustrated devoted an [article](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/5080-the-white-bread-that-converted-a-diehard-sourdough-baker) 
to this Japanese white bread in their May/June 2022 issue.

The ingredients includes a _yudane_, a boiling water and flour mixture
that is similar to a _tangzhong_, except the latter uses plain water 
that is cooked with the flour. I loved the shaping technique, which
involves dividing the risen dough into four pieces, then rolling them
into snails that are then placed side-by-side in the long Pullman pan.

I let me bread proof a little too long, but the end result was still
pretty tasty. The crust was surprisingly chewy, I didn't expect that
from a loaf whose interior is so fluffy. My newest cookbook has a
recipe for milk bread also, so I'm going to give that a try next.
