excerpt: "I used the leftover pear poaching liquid plus a cinnamon stick for poaching the quinces. The fruit was tender but still held its shape when I removed it from the heat. Cooking the apples was problematic: there was a lot of liquid in the pan, so I drained about a half cup before adding the cornstarch"

The fruit was tender but still held its shape when I removed it from the heat. Cooking the apples was problematic: there was a lot of liquid in the pan, so I drained about a half cup before adding the cornstarch mixture. My challah was a bit too stale as the pieces weren't very squishy so it was hard to get a tight fit. The only charlotte mold Golda's Kitchen carried was non-stick, so I just bought a 7" panettone pan instead. As for the finished dessert, it was interesting. Crunchy buttery bread on the outside, and a sweet-tart soft fruit mixture on the inside.
