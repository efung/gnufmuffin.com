Also, it has a rounded edge which makes lining the pan difficult. On the plus side, the bars don't stick to the sides! I made the curd over a double-boiler; it's very tasty, smooth and balanced. There's an awful lot of eggs though: 7 yolks plus two eggs. Unfortunately, the base was too thick; next time, I'll hold some of the crust back (or use a bigger pan).
