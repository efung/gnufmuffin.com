excerpt: "Continuing the bran muffin baking spree, I tried this recipe out to use up some (really) dried figs. They were so hard I had trouble cutting them with my knife; I made sure they soaked in the boiling water to rehydrate them. I added a half cup of finely chopped pecans to the batter. Instead of two dozen"

They were so hard I had trouble cutting them with my knife; I made sure they soaked in the boiling water to rehydrate them. I added a half cup of finely chopped pecans to the batter. Instead of two dozen muffins, I topped up the batter and came out with 17 jumbo muffins. Watch out that they don't burn, especially the tops that come in contact with the tins. While there's nothing wrong with these muffins, they're not particularly tasty.
