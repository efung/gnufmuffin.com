On Sunday evening, before heading off for a few days in Ottawa, I made a
loaf of bread so my family would have some breakfast toast. The way that
Michael Ruhlman describes this bread, I thought it would make a
delicious whole-grain loaf. Alas, it did not meet my expectations.

The headnote on the
[recipe](http://ruhlman.com/2011/01/multigrain-bread/) describes “how
un-dense, how un-heavy” the loaf is, which is often an attribute of
whole-grain loaves. Unfortunately, this bread was crumbly, dense
and heavy. 

My only substitution was brown rice flour for buckwheat. I followed
every other measure, and did 10 minutes of kneading in the mixer.
It didn't pass the windowpane test, and at that point, I should
have kneaded longer. I did give it a full 3 hours to do the first
rise, and almost 90 minutes rise after transferring to a banneton.  

While in the basket, the bottom of the loaf (on top) split and cracked.
I preheated the baking stone, and flipped the risen loaf directly onto
it. The loaf split unattractively in the oven, despite the slashes, and
didn't brown very much.

There's a pretty high proportion of whole grains to bread flour, so it's
not surprising this didn't turn out the way I expected. Perhaps this
crumbly, dense texture is acceptable for some, but not to me. Maybe a
little bit of sugar or honey would encourage the yeast a bit, or maybe
more white flour would help. Ruhlman has a [followup
recipe](http://ruhlman.com/2014/06/gluten-free-malarkey-and-my-recipe-for-multigrain-bread/)
which is very similar, but uses a bit more water, and uses a Dutch
oven for baking. However, I don't think I'll try it.
