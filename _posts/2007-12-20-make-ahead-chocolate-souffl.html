The basic recipe made 8 servings, and I only needed two for last night's dinner, so I decided on making a half recipe of the make-ahead version. In this recipe, the yolks are partially cooked by stirring a hot sugar syrup into them, and the whites are stabilized by beating sugar into them. I used Grand Marnier as suggested instead of the orange zest. In the morning, I put the filled ramekins in the freezer before going to work. In the evening, 16 minutes in the oven weren't quite enough to set the centre, but two extra minutes finished them. Yum: these were very chocolatey (I used the <a href="http://qzina.com/product.php?categoriesID=37&idProduct=252&count=40">Chocoa Extreme 72% Bittersweet</a> I bought from Qzina) and light in texture, especially right out of the oven. The directions say that the frozen cups can keep in the freezer up to 2 days, which is too bad, since I would love to be able to pop a ramekin into the oven whenever I feel like having a soufflé!
