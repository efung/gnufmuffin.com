With Fridays off during the summer, I can easily make fresh bread for Shabbat 
dinner. Since we had no more frozen, store-bought challahs, I decided to make one 
from a recipe I've been meaning to try, featuring olive oil and orange juice.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018481-olive-oil-challah) comes from
New York Times Cooking. I had a bunch of errands to run during the morning, so I made
sure to take out my eggs and oranges from the fridge to let them warm to room temperature, 
until I could make the dough after lunch. 

I made this challah following the recipe pretty closely, and used the optional
orange zest. I needed almost the full 3 hours for it to double, as the weather
has been quite cool lately. For shaping, I stuck with a simple three-rope braid.

My house smelled amazing, with the fragrance of fresh bread mixed
with the heady aroma of citrus. The loaf browned beautifully thanks
to two coats of egg wash. It was also quite light and fluffy, with
a beautiful golden interior thanks to the three yolks and orange
juice. This _pareve_ loaf is a winner, and one I'll definitely 
make again in the future. I can't wait to try it in French toast!
