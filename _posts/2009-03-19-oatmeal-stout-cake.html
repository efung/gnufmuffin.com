excerpt: "Beer is not a common ingredient in sweet baking. The only times I\'ve used it that I really enjoyed are in cherry muffins and in the CI no-knead bread. But stouts are dark beers and their taste often suggests chocolate or coffee. I first made this cake many years ago with with the broiled icing but omitted"

The only times I've used it that I really enjoyed are in <a href="/2006/02/dried-cherry-beer-muffins.html">cherry muffins</a> and in the CI no-knead <a href="/2008/04/almost-no-knead-whole-wheat-bread.html">bread</a>. But stouts are dark beers and their taste often suggests chocolate or coffee. I first made this cake many years ago with with the broiled icing but omitted the topping this time around. Soaking the oats in the beer softens them up, but the thick flakes still provide a bit of chew in the cake. Don't put too much orange zest in like I did, or else that's all you will taste. It's an interesting cake, but not tasty enough that I would make it on a regular basis. Perhaps toasting the oat flakes would enhance their nuttiness.
