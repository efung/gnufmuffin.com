excerpt: "I loosely followed the given recipe but since it\'s so simple, I\'ll describe it here. After blanching and peeling the peaches, I put chunks of it in a food processor and chopped them finely. I measured out five cups of peach pulp, then combined it with one cup of Viognier wine, a tablespoon of lemon"

After blanching and peeling the peaches, I put chunks of it in a food processor and chopped them finely. I measured out five cups of peach pulp, then combined it with one cup of <a href="http://www.fairview.co.za/index.php?page_id=8&prd_category=2&prod_id=103">Viognier</a> wine, a tablespoon of lemon juice and a packet of Bernardin No-Sugar Pectin. After bringing it to a boil, I added three-quarters of a cup of honey then boiled hard for three minutes, then canned and processed. The jam set quite softly but wasn't runny; this was expected since I used more fruit pulp than the packet would set. Viognier is a new favourite white wine for me as I love how there is an apricot and floral aroma to it. The honey balances out the acidity of the peaches, as I found the last batch of no-sugar jam I made too tangy.
