This is something I've made before, but I wanted to try their recipe. Unfortunately, it was not successful in my opinion, despite the reviews of my tasters. I found the vanilla to be overwhelming: one vanilla bean plus one tablespoon of extract. Due to the hazelnut paste, the texture was crumbly and not smooth. The best hazelnut gelato I've ever made was <a href="/2005/05/hazelnut-gelato.html">this one</a> and this wasn't anything like that.
