Nonetheless, I forged ahead with my deep-frying plan. Tim Horton's sells a cruller, one of my favourite donuts (the others being sour-cream glazed, and walnut twist), but I've never tried to make them. <br /><br />This recipe calls for making the <i>pâté à choux</i> batter, then piping it into rings, and freezing it briefly, for easier transfer from pan to oil. I couldn't find my piping bag for the first batch, and just made blobs with a cookie scoop. This turned out to be a mistake. After freezing them for a few hours, the dense mass was not fully cooked by the time the outside was golden brown. Cutting the blobs into smaller pieces made bite-sized cruller bits that were perfect. You know when it's cooked when the exterior starts to crack and split, due to the steam expanding the interior.<br /><br />I bought a pastry bag before the second batch, and used a star trip to pipe rings. These turned out much nicer, delicate and hollow, with a pronounced eggy flavour. They really need a sprinkling of sugar or dip into glaze, as a whole donut is pretty plain on its own. As with most deep-fried items, eat them fresh, as after a few days, they're just greasy sponges.
