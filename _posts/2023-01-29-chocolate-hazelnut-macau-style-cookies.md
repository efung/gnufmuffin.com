I bought _Mooncakes and Milk Bread_ by Kristina Cho last
Mother's Day: one copy for my Mom, and a copy for myself. But I haven't
tried to make any of the recipes until recently. This crumbly cookie
was a great intro to the author's fresh interpretations of classic
Chinese bakery favorites.

The headnote to the [recipe](https://www.mocanyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MOCA_COOKS_Chocolate-Hazelnut_Macau-Style_Cookies_Recipe_and_Techniques.pdf) talks about the traditional Macau almond cookie and the deviations
the author took. I was able to find mung bean flour, so I used that 
instead of the kinako (roasted soybean) flour she calls for as an
easier substitution.

The dough was quite sticky and was hard to work with, so I did chill
it for about an hour. After weighing the entire mass, I scaled out
10 equal balls, then pressed them right onto the Silpat-lined sheet pan
with a cookie stamp. (I have yet to purchase a mooncake mold press!)

I liked these crumbly cookies a lot, and as she notes in the recipe,
they taste just like a Ferrero Rocher chocolate. I want to make
the more traditional kind with almond flour for comparison.

You can see the author making these cookies in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kXjCoSeOpE).
