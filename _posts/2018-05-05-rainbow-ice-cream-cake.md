For my daughter's birthday, she asked me to make her a rainbow cake.
This gave me pause because most of the rainbow cakes you see on
Pinterest are made with artificial food coloring, but I try to avoid
that whenever possible. The natural colorings made from fruit or
vegetable purees, come out pastel at best. Things were
made considerably easier when she amended her request to be an ice
cream cake. Now, my job was made much simpler.

Fruit purées on their own are intensely colorful. Made into a sorbet,
they retain that vibrancy. Fruit-based ice creams or sherbets,
though, pale in comparison (ha ha). So my plan was to stick with
as many dairy-free sorbets as possible to get the brightest possible colors.

Dr. S suggested not to follow the [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROYGBIV)
but to alternate colors to maximize contrast. So here are the flavours we planned
and made (top-to-bottom in the photo above):

1. vanilla ice cream
1. raspberry sherbet
1. kiwi-lulo sorbet
1. blackberry-blueberry sorbet
1. mango sorbet

To make an easy-to-slice ice cream cake, I lined two 8.5×4.5" loaf pans with 
clingfilm, and made 1 to 1.5 quarts of each flavour. After spreading each flavour
in the pans, I covered them with more clingfilm, then put them in the freezer for 
at least 4 hours.

I used the vanilla ice cream recipe from the 
[Van Leeuwen cookbook](http://www.vanleeuwenicecream.com/merchandise-1/cookbook). 
It has a suggestion that I hadn't seen before: pulverizing a vanilla bean with the
cream in a Vitamix, before heating and infusing it. This worked out well for me,
because the beans that I have are dried out.

For the raspberry layer, I used the [raspberry sherbet recipe](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/fresh-raspberry-sherbet-366011#activity-feed) from Cook's Illustrated.
This is egg-free so is a bit easier to make than ice cream, as you don't have to
make a custard. For all of the other layers, I used a blend of frozen purees
(I got the [lulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_quitoense) and blackberry
at a Latin grocery) as well as fresh fruit, making up 3 cups in total. I combined
that with 1 cup of rich simple syrup.

I learned a few lessons while making this ice cream cake. To get even layers, consider
the shape of the pan: a pan with angled sides is narrower at the bottom, so use a bit
less. Also, ensure that each flavor batch you're making has the same yield: the
mango recipe I made only produced 0.75 quart (whereas the others were about 1 to 1.5 
quarts). Slicing this cake was a snap, since the sorbets don't freeze solid. To
ensure success, dip your knife in hot water, and clean between slices.
