For a quick, easy-to-make snack for a small group meeting at our house, I
made this frosted cake. While I didn't think it was particularly
delicious, it's always nice to have something chocolate-y around.

The [recipe](https://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/is-this-chocolate-cake-recipe-from-yotam-ottolenghis-baking-cookbook-sweet-the-worlds-best-20170920-gylnoz#chocolate) is from [_Sweet_](/tag/sweet-ottolenghi/), but
first appeared in an Australian newspaper. Ingredient-wise, it has the usual tricks to enhance flavour,
like vanilla and instant coffee. As is common with British recipes, it calls for self-rising flour, which
can be purchased in grocery stores here in Canada, but can be [made easily at home](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/homemade-self-rising-flour-recipe).

I was disappointed in this cake. The headnotes promise that it could be described as "world's easiest" 
or "most versatile" or even, hyperbolically, "world's best". But I didn't find it to be any of those things. 
The texture was dense, and didn't have a satisfying mouthfeel. It wasn't like a "cake mix" version (oily, soft, 
moist) and only the ganache frosting saved it from being a total failure.
