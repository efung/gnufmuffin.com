It's peak corn season in Ontario, and we bought 15 ears at St. Lawrence
Market on the weekend. After making an intensely, superb [corn
soup](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/08/pressure-cooker-corn-soup-recipe.html),
I decided to try making muffins out of some of the remaining cobs.

This
[recipe](http://www.mission-food.com/2014/10/bouchon-bakery-corn-muffins.html)
is fairly straightforward. It called for fine cornmeal, but I used
a package labelled “corn flour” from my pantry which looked like cornmeal to
me. I didn't want to just leave a tablespoon of egg around, so I used
3 whole eggs in total for a double recipe, leaving me about 30g short.

As with all of the muffins in the Bouchon Bakery cookbook, the
recipe calls for letting the batter rest overnight in the fridge.
I baked one batch after an 8 hour rest in the fridge, and another batch
after 36 hours. They both turned out nicely, with very slightly golden tops,
and a super crumbly texture. Maybe that's because I used a blend of 
AP/cake/bread flour, and/or the slightly reduced amount of egg. The
flavour is strongly salty and sweet, so both of those ingredients could
be reduced next time.
