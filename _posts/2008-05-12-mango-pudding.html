However, I found a copy of this recipe which I had copied out by hand for some reason. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Instead, I made the simple syrup and soaked a dried out vanilla bean in it for a day, before combining it with all of the other ingredients. I used part of the reduced mango puree in the pudding (leftover from the habanos chocolates). As I was making this for a bake sale fundraiser at work, I portioned the pudding in about two dozen small paper cups. This turned out to be a bit of a problem, as the thin walls made for a wobbly container. The flavour is pure mango, but a bit of lemon or lime juice would have balanced the sweetness. A little less liquid would have made it firmer; also, the colour darkened after 48 hours, so it's best to eat this right away.
