It's that time of year when vegetable gardeners start looking for new and exciting ways to use the bountiful squash harvest. This time, I turned to the Interweb and found this recipe for a chocolate loaf. It's dead simple to make: I made a double loaf using one very large zucchini, shredded with the fine disc on my food processor. Instead of chocolate chips, I added whole walnuts. In the future, I would chop them up a bit to make slicing the loaf cleaner. Not too bad, this loaf had the texture of "cake-mix" cakes but it's moist and satisfying.
