My son has been asking about apple ice cream for some reason, and this
past weekend, I decided to make a batch. Unfortunately, we forgot to
serve it at our extended family dinner, but that just meant more for
me and the kids!

The note on the [recipe](https://recipes.latimes.com/recipe-roasted-apple-ice-cream/) 
I found says it's by [Roxana Jullapat](https://www.instagram.com/roxanajullapat/). 
What I like about it, is that you roast the apples to concentrate and caramelize 
them a bit. I used a mix of whatever fruit I had in the fridge: this week, it was 
Granny Smith and Honeycrisp.

Sour cream rounds out the flavour of the base, giving it a distinct tangy flavour.
We really, _really_ liked this ice cream. It's not too sweet, and is very reminiscent
of apple pie.
