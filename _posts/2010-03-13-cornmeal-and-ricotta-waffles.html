The addition of cornmeal adds a little crunch, but the crispiness comes from the whipped egg whites. And are these waffles ever crisp and light-tasting! Definitely would make again.<br /><br />N.B.: All pictures of waffles look the same. There's really no value to me including a photo of a waffle. By the way, those little berries on top are wild strawberries from a bottle of <a href="http://www.fragoli.com/">Fragoli</a>.
