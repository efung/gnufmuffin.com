The huge, juicy fruit was skinned, then tossed in a mixture of butter and brown sugar, then sprinkled with juice and liqueur. I made the frangipane in the food processor, then placed lumps of it in the peach cavities. While they baked, I made a creme anglaise to go with the peaches. Twice. Unfortunately, I let the mixture boil the first time, and scrambled the eggs. Whoops. The second time around, I used a thermometer to keep an eye on the temperature. When things got past 190&deg;F, I took the pot off the heat, but the mixture was still very runny. I wonder whether you have to heat the custard more gently for a longer period of time for it to thicken? I'll have to dig out my copy of <i>On Food and Cooking</i> and see what McGee says about custards. Anyway, this dessert was both hit and miss. While the warm fruit, aromatic frangipane and creamy sauce were sublime together, I also didn't like the mild tartness of the peaches, nor the overly firm baked centre and runny accompaniment. Perhaps one mistake was leaving the dessert in the turned-off oven while we ate?
