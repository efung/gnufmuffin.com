I'm about halfway through all the muffin recipes in [Bouchon
Bakery](/tag/Bouchon Bakery), and finally got around to making one of my
favourite varieties, blueberry.

The
[recipe](http://www.foodgal.com/2012/11/bouchon-bakerys-incomparable-blueberry-muffins/)
is straightforward, and incorporates molasses, honey and granulated
sugar as sweeteners. Watch out for the divided quantities of all-purpose
flour in the recipe! The first amount is for tossing into the frozen
blueberries, the second is for the batter. I didn't discover my mistake
of omitting the second amount, until my wife reported a strange,
bubbling mess baking in the jumbo tins. Needless to say, these went
straight to the compost bin.

The overnight refrigerated rest turned this smooth batter into a thick,
stiff mixture. Despite the floured, frozen blueberries coming straight
out of the freezer, it was difficult to incorporate the fruit without
crushing them and staining the batter. In the future, I would let the 
batter warm for an hour or so.

I needed a full hour of baking time, 15 minutes more than the listed upper
range. These muffins were very tender, and very full of blueberries.
Next time, I'll try topping them with almond streusel (I used
leftover oat streusel from the [carrot
muffins](/2015/03/carrot-muffins-bouchon.html)).
