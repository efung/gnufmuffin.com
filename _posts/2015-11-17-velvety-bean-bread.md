Another untried bread from [Homebaking](/tag/homebaking/) was
this loaf made with puréed navy beans. It was an interesting
experiment, a way to add fibre and protein to our diet,
but in the end, it couldn't hold our interest.

I used a pressure cooker to prepare the beans; the
[recipe](http://www.mnn.com/food/recipes/stories/easy-navy-bean-bread) 
calls for either cooked or canned. The dough is pretty standard,
with the exception of the bean purée. The first rise, is 3 hours,
and the second, is 2½ hours, so leave yourself lots of time.

The baked loaves didn't colour very much, and they weren't as 
velvety as the title would suggest. After a few days, we stopped
eating it for breakfast toast, and turned it into garlic croutons.
