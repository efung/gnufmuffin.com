This recipe certainly didn't disappoint. My only change to the recipe was to make it gluten-free and letting the batter rest for 5 minutes so that the cornmeal could absorb some of the liquid. Make sure you grease the griddle all the way to the edges, so that when the batter puffs and begins to ooze out the sides, it won't stick when you open up the waffle iron. I liked how every bite or so, you get a little piece of salty bacon.
