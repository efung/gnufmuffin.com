A fellow baker at work tipped me off to this German apple cake.
I filed it away to make for company because it sounded so good.
This week, I finally had the chance and it was the star of
Friday night dinner.

The [recipe](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/apfel-marzipan-kuchen-german-apple-almond-cake-recipe/) is from David Lebovitz' website, who said
he got it from _Classic German Baking_ by Luisa Weiss. There's a 
lot of bowls needed for this recipe, but I promise you, it's worth
it. A few notable things: the almond paste is grated to break it
up and disperse it into the sugar; the apples are incorporated
in two ways, as cubes for the batter, and slices for the topping.

I found this cake to be fantastic, and I know our guests did too, based
on the chorus of "Oh, wow" and requests for seconds. It's a touch
too sweet for me, given the trio of almond paste, sugar, and apricot jam,
so next time, I'd cut down on the sugar. But highly, highly recommended.
