For a nice snack to share with colleagues this week, I made a simple
one-bowl treat that showcased paper-thin Golden Delicious apples.
It resembled a thick pancake or clafouti, and was delicious warm
or cold.

The [recipe](http://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/custardy-apple-squares)
can be found in Dorie Greenspan's [Baking Chez Moi](/tag/baking-chez-moi/). I have a fancy
food processor with an adjustable slicer blade, and it took a few tries to figure out the
setting to yield slices one-sixteenth of an inch thick (Note to future self: set the dial
to just past 1 on the Breville disc). After cutting all the apples, making the batter
was very straightforward: whip the eggs and sugar by hand, combine with the other wet 
ingredients, then whisk in the dry ones. Finally, the sliced fruit is folded in.

I thought that the 40-50 minute baking would be excessive, but these
squares did need that long for the top to brown. Eaten about a half
hour after they came out of the oven, the squares were tender, buttery
and filled with warm fruit. The apples had cooked through but you could
still detect distinct layers. A day later, served at room temperature,
the squares were firmer, almost rubbery, but still good.
