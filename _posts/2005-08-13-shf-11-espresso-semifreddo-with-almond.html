This is my contribution to <a href="http://www.lovesicily.com/blog/food-and-drink/2005/08/14/shf11-a-handfull-or-two-of-coffee-beans/">SHF #11</a>, hosted by Ronald at loveSicily, and the theme is <b>coffee</b>.<br /><br />I'm not a regular coffee drinker (caffeine on an empty stomach makes me tremble!) although I enjoy a cup once in a while. However, the aroma of coffee and its use as a flavouring is something that I love. I thought of a photograph of a coffee cup made out of ice cream from an old magazine and dug out the recipe for Espresso Semifreddo served on an Almond Florentine. Gusto!, a food magazine, is no longer published by the Globe and Mail but I fortunately have a handful of old issues. This recipe came from the Summer June 1997 issue. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/33749514" title="Espresso semifreddo with almond florentine by Eric Fung, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/21/33749514_9b73ae1eaf_m.jpg" width="240" height="195" alt="Espresso semifreddo with almond florentine" class="inlineleft"></a>The recipe's only coffee component came from the extract (as well as the shape of the dessert!) so I knew I wanted to boost the flavour some more. Taking some whole coffee beans, I crushed them and let them infuse in half the whipping cream overnight. To the egg yolk and sugar mixture, I added &frac12; tsp of instant espresso powder. During a shopping trip at Whole Foods, I couldn't find any white chocolate other than the Lindt Excellence Natural Vanilla so that's what I used. While microwaving it to melt it, the chocolate developed a hot spot on the inside and ended up caramelizing. It wasn't totally burnt so I just stirred in the brown bits which had the side effect of adding a mocha colour to the cream mixture. The semifreddo is pretty simple to make, although it does require a lot of bowls.<br /><br />For the florentines, by warming the butter until it was almost melted, I found it much easier to blend with the orange juice. Keeping the theme in mind, I substituted Kahl√∫a for Grand Marnier. The disks really spread out in the oven, so I could only bake six at a time. Using a tart mold as a makeshift cookie cutter, I made rounds and draped them over saucers and the bottom of some mugs. They harden quickly so you have to shape them while they're still hot.<br /><br />Assembly was a bit of a problem. First, I forgot to keep the florentines in an airtight container so they softened. A quick trip in the toaster oven followed by another cooling re-crisped them. Secondly, the semifreddo didn't freeze very solidly in the espresso cups and they melted very quickly in the warm kitchen. This led to a very flat and saddened appearance to the whole dessert. My tasters kept calling them teapots! You can see what it's supposed to look like in the background of the photo.<br /><br />But, of course, taste is paramount and this dessert delivers. The &ldquo;cup&rdquo; is smooth and rich, with a wonderful coffee flavour punctuated by bits of caramelized white chocolate. The almonds give a nice crunch to the &ldquo;saucers&rdquo; and the orange flavour is quite noticeable.
