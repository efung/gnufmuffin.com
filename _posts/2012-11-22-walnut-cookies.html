excerpt: "These cookies aren't anything like a walnut version of Chinese almond cookies. For starters, it doesn't use ground nuts in the batter, and the refrigeration step makes the sugars dissolve into the butter, giving the final cookie a butterscotch flavour. Do make the cookies small though, as they spread"

For starters, it doesn't use ground nuts in the batter, and the refrigeration step makes the sugars dissolve into the butter, giving the final cookie a butterscotch flavour. Do make the cookies small though, as they spread out quite a bit, and will be undercooked if you follow the baking time. Not a cookie I'd make again.
