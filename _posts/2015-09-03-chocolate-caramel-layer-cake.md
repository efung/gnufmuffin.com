As a token of appreciation for the nanny who took care of our children
this summer, we decided to bake her a cake. The Sep 2015 issue of Cook's
Illustrated provided the
[recipe](http://www.treats-sf.com/2015/08/chocolate-caramel-layer-cake.html)
for this sweet treat, combining chocolate cake with the
bittersweet flavour of caramel.

The chocolate cake was a straightforward, two-bowl affair. I have two
identical 9" pans, so it was easy to weigh them after filling, to
ensure the batter was divided evenly. The baked layers didn't need
two full hours to cool: in an air-conditioned basement, they were
done in about an hour.

On the same evening, I made the caramel filling. The tips in this recipe
were very informative. Molten sugar seizes and crystallizes 
when the heat is too _low_, causing the sucrose to bond, rather than
melting and breaking down into other sugars. This CI recipe is a
"wet" caramel, one that has added water, to help dissolve and spread
the sugar mixture so it melts evenly. The only tricky part is that the
boiling sugar bubbles vigorously, so you want to use a deep enough pot,
and to tilt it so that your thermometer can accurately check whether
you've reached the target temperature.

Once the caramel had cooled, I split the cakes into four thin layers,
and spread the caramel between them. I wrapped the whole thing in
plastic until the next morning. 
The original recipe calls for a from-scratch chocolate
frosting, but we had some leftover ganache in our freezer.
A thin coat provided a nice chocolate kick in every forkful.

I wasn't certain that I would like this cake, but it turned out to be
very delicious. The caramel wasn't too cloying, and its distinctive
burnt sugar flavour stood out.
