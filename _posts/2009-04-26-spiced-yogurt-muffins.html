Putting the dry ingredients in a food processor worked out well for me, because my brown sugar was lumpy and hard. Blitzing it for a minute pulverized all the chunks into a fine powder. For textural interest, I added two chopped Golden Delicious apples and a handful of toasted pumpkin seeds. I made this recipe in 12 muffin cups, and baked it for 25 minutes. Not my tastiest effort, but a decent breakfast muffin.
