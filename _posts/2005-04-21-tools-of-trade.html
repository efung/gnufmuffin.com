<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/10242286" title="Kitchen gadgets by Eric Fung, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/7/10242286_c0e7870b54_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Kitchen gadgets" class="inlineright"></a>Before I enrolled in this course, I knew that I had to buy some equipment for use in the class. During the first morning, our instructor walked us through the list (which was different from the one on the <a href="http://coned.georgebrown.ca/section/culi/barttoolkit.html">website</a>). I'm glad I waited because there were many things that he said we didn't need. For our convenience, we could order all the items through the School but who would pay $180 for a caddy to carry around kitchen gadgets when a $20 plastic toolbox works just as well?!<br /><br />The equipment list: apron, plastic coated pastry bag, #3 and #5 plain pastry tubes, #2, #4 and #6 closed star pastry tubes, cake comb, wooden spoon, bowl scraper, swivel peeler, wire whisk, pastry brush, paring knife, straight spatula, scalloped slicer, heat-resistent spatula and tea towels.<br /><br />My scavenger hunt led me to six stores:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.goldaskitchen.com/">Golda's Kitchen</a>&mdash; A specialty store with a great selection of baking supplies. I got all the cake decorating stuff here.</li> <li><a href="http://www.cayneshousewares.com/">Cayne's Housewares</a>&mdash; Discount superstore carrying kitchen appliances, gadgets and other housewares. Highly recommended, as they have very competitive prices, especially for things like blenders, food processors, etc.</li> <li><a href="http://www.kitchenstuffplus.com/">Kitchen Stuff Plus</a>&mdash; I didn't buy anything here, but in the past, I've bought cutlery and knives from them.</li> <li><a href="http://www.hbc.com/giftregistryHO">Home Outfitters</a>&mdash; I didn't get anything here either, but the selection is good, even if the prices aren't.</li> <li><a href="http://www.sears.ca/">Sears</a>&mdash; I got an apron here.</li> <li><a href="http://gbcbookstore.bookware3000.ca/">George Brown College Bookstore</a>&mdash; They carry chef whites (aprons, hats, pants) and most of the equipment for the cooking classes. Most of the equipment actually comes from <a href="http://www.canadacutlery.com/">Canada Cutlery Inc.</a>, and is the company you have to deal with regarding returns. I got the scalloped slicer here.</li> </ul>
