For a Lunar New Year party we were invited to, we made these
sesame cookies. They were so good, that I made them again and 
again over the next few weeks.

The New York Times Cooking [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023820-black-sesame-shortbread) requires a food processor to grind 
the sesame, sugar, and flour together. The machine also makes it easy to
incorporate the butter and produce a homogeneous dough. For one
of our vegan hosts, I made one batch using a plant-based butter
alternative, and it turned out just as well as the batch with regular
cow butter.

After chilling for more than 2 hours, the logs were quite firm, and 
the sliced rounds tended to crack easily. Letting them warm up a bit 
helped to keep their shape. Don't forget to roll the log as you slice
to ensure perfectly round shapes.

Sprinkling the white sesame on top to match the article's photo proved
to be a bit of a challenge. After trying various techniques (pressing
the cookies into a line of sesame, using foil as a mask), what worked
best was water. Painting the cookie with a wet brush, then spooning
the seeds over top ensured that they stuck where we wanted them.

The cookies spread a little bit, and smelled extremely fragrant while
they baked. Kept tightly sealed, they stayed fresh and crisp for up to
a week. I loved the flavour and colour contrast of these cookies. 
Highly recommended.
