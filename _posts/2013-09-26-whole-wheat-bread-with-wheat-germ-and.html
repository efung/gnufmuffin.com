It didn't turn out as delicious as this other <a href="/2013/07/whole-wheat-sandwich-bread.html">whole wheat loaf</a>. The recipe isn't as accurately specified as current CI recipes are, and doesn't have weight measurements, nor did it specify what kind of yeast to use, active-dry or instant. I used the former, and think that was responsible for producing a dense loaf that didn't rise very much during the initial proofing nor during baking. Still, sliced thinly, the bread was good as toast.
