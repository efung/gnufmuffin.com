We've started to have small groups over for dinner parties again. On Friday,
some of our guests preferred to avoid mixing 
[meat and dairy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_and_meat_in_Jewish_law)
so I was looking for some desserts that were vegan as those would automatically
have no butter or milk. In the end, I found a dairy-free chocolate cake that
kept our dinner pareve.

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/dairy-free-chocolate-cake) is by
Stella Parks. I love that her recipes include weights in grams, and whether
the temperature of ingredients are important. This attention to detail really
helps to ensure a consistent result.

This cake required minimal work, just whisking the ingredients together in the
right order. From start to oven, it took less than 15 minutes. I actually made
this single cake layer twice, to make a more substantial dessert for 13 people.
Each time, the dome in the middle was quite pronounced.

After letting both layers cool, I sliced the top off one of them, then spread
a nice rhubarb-orange jam in between. Easy peasy. The cake was well received.
It wasn't quite like a boxed cake mix, but I did like that it was easy to make,
and one I'll keep in mind the next time I need a dairy-free cake.
