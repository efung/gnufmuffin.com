Over [Hanukkah](http://www.gnufmuffin.com/tag/hanukkah/) this year
in Florida, I made this easy chocolate pudding from an Alice Medrich
recipe. It was a big hit, in both low-sugar and regular versions.
For a dinner we hosted on Friday night, we served it again to a
group of enthusiastic children.

The [recipe](http://alicemedrich.com/recipe/my-chocolate-pudding-3-0/)
calls for combining a few dry ingredients in a pot, along with milk
and cream, and heating everything gently. The hot mixture is cooled
with chopped chocolate, and flavoured with vanilla and rum. Depending
on how thick you like pudding, and the cocoa percentage of your
chocolate, you can vary how much to incorporate.

Don't fill your ramekins or glasses too full: the pudding is rich.
After chilling the individual portions thoroughly, we garnished
each serving with some softly whipped cream, and chocolate sprinkles.
This pudding was a little too firm (the chocolate I used was a 70% dark)
but delivered a satisfyingly intense flavour.
