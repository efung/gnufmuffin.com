It wasn't until the last two nights of Passover that we _needed_ to make
another dessert. That [first cake](/2021/03/almond-cake-with-cardamom-and-pistachio.html) was so
good, we kept slicing off slivers of it every day of _Pesach_. But, when all that was left was crumbs,
the lure of sesame, cream, and honey kept calling, so I went back into the kitchen to bake.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9385-flourless-chocolate-cake-with-halvah-honey-sauce)
is by Melissa Clark from New York Times Cooking. It's a pretty standard flourless chocolate cake,
using eggs whipped into a foam, with a shot of brandy in there for good measure.

But the sauce was definitely not as commonplace. After heating heavy cream to a simmer,
I whisked in tahini, honey, and salt. Surprisingly, it began to thicken. Once cool,
I crumbled in some [pistachio halvah](https://parallelbrothers.com/collections/halva/products/halva-almond-cardamon)
from Parallel Brothers, a Toronto based restaurant and caterer that [sells their sesame creations online](https://parallelbrothers.com/pages/online-store).

Still warm, and generously spooned over and under the cake, the
sauce propelled this dessert to another level of complexity. Halvah
is sweet, bitter, and grainy, and not familiar to me as an ingredient
alongside cream. But it was very addictive. If you're looking for
something different, do try this cake, and perhaps make 
[tahini-halvah brownies](/2017/11/tahini-and-halva-brownies.html) as
a chaser.
