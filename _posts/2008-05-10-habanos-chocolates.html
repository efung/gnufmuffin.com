First, I infused the cream with a whole sliced jalapeno as I didn't find habaneros in the major supermarkets. The slabbed ganache set up very quickly at a cool room temperature so I was pleased with my tempering; it is getting better with practise! On the same day, I also made the mango layer. Boy, does it take a long time to reduce the pulpy mango puree. I didn't let it go to one-half volume, maybe two-thirds or so. This might have been responsible for the splitting of the ganache. I poured it over the first layer and let it set. A day or so later, I applied the precoat and let that set for another day. On Saturday morning, I dipped the pieces in semisweet chocolate then applied a transfer sheet on top. The finished chocolates set beautifully with very little streaking and only a bit of pooling at the base. Each layer has its own contribution: the bottom has a bit of heat from the pepper, and the top provides colour and tanginess. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Chris has a nice set of step-by-step <a href="http://www.chrishennes.com/Confections/Pages/Habanos.html">photos</a> for making these.
