No holiday box would be complete without something chocolatey. And candy canes
are definitely one of the most seasonal sweets at this time of the year. Put
them together, and you get this peppermint brownie cookie.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022771-peppermint-brownie-cookies) is
another one from the [24 Days of Cookies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/30/dining/cookie-calendar.html)
calendar from 2021. I'll let Dr. S tell the story, as she made these start to finish:

> We were waiting for a package to arrive. When Eric took the kids to school, I needed to wait before I could leave and walk the dog. It was the perfect window to squeeze in a cookie project.
>
> I love all things chocolate and mint. So these cookies were really exciting to me. To make them extra chocolatey, you use both semi-sweet chocolate and cocoa powder. You also amp up the minty flavour with peppermint extract. 
>
> I especially liked how unfussy it was with regards to the butter. Because you get to use melted butter, you donâ€™t have to wait for it to reach room temperature: it went straight from the fridge to the micro and into the bowl in no time! (Hint: no advance planning necessary). 
>
> I was very pleased with how easy they were to throw together and how yummy they turned out. Would definitely make again!
