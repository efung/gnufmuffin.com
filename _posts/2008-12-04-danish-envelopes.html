I've used this recipe before, and love its combination of flavours including orange zest and cardamom. It's fairly easy to make, provided you have a stand mixer to do the kneading and decent skills with a rolling pin. The resting period between turns is the most time consuming part and can't be rushed. I've never had much success with shaping danishes. The folded corners always spring back as the dough rises, and when it puffs up in the oven. On one batch, I tried using toothpicks to hold them in place but that didn't work too well. I may have used too much flour during rolling, or baked them for about 5 or 10 minutes too long, because these turned out quite crispy and crunchy. But I really loved the jams that I used, a mirabelle plum preserve and a Saskatoon berry one (the latter from Costco!).
