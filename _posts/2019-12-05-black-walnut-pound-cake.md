I first heard about **black walnuts** when a colleague at one of my internships 
told me the hardwood was highly prized, and that he would love to one day
grow an orchard full of them. Some twenty years later, I finally
tried some at a [supermarket in Florida](/2019/04/matzo-caramel-crunch.html).
Less than a year later, I finally tracked down a Canadian source.

[Grimo Nut Nursery](https://www.grimonut.com/) is in Niagara, ON and 
sells nuts to eat, nut trees, harvesting tools, as well as fruiting
trees like persimmon, quince, and mulberry. They sell black walnuts
both shelled, and in-shell. A pound of shelled black walnuts is $16
CAD. Despite the high cost and shipping, I ordered some at the end
of October.

What to make with them first? I decided on a pound cake by Sherry Yard,
from her [Secrets of Baking](/tag/the-secrets-of-baking/) book which 
follows the classic formula of equal parts of eggs, sugar, and flour.
I didn't have quite enough cake flour, so I used a 50-50 blend with
all-purpose (which is suggested in the recipe). I also omitted the
vanilla per her suggestion when making a the nut variation, and
instead added one heaping cup of toasted black walnuts.

The cake turned out okay. It was quite pale (must be the butter
and/or eggs this time of year), and somewhat dense (probably over
mixed). But the walnuts were definitely the star: lots of crunch
and pops of flavour in every mouthful. Many sources suggest
making a pecan pie, but substituting black walnuts. I'll have
to try that next!
