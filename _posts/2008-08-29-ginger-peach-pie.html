excerpt: "With all of the peaches everywhere, I wanted to make a pie that featured this juicy fruit. Last week, I tried this recipe and was pleased enough to make it again last night. Instead of their crust, I used the CI vodka pie crust, replacing the vegetable shortening with lard. This made the crust much softer"

Last week, I tried this recipe and was pleased enough to make it again last night. Instead of their crust, I used the CI vodka pie crust, replacing the vegetable shortening with lard. This made the crust much softer and a little stickier to roll. I also pulverized the tapioca in a coffee grinder. The recipe doesn't mention what to do with the 2 tbsp of butter; most recipes have you put little bits on top of the filling. I just left it out completely. The filling turned kind of pinkish after baking. While the flavour is excellent, with a subtle hint of ginger, not too sweet, I found the texture a bit odd. The tapioca does a good job of gelling the juices but even ground up, it made the pie slightly lumpy. Maybe a combination of cornstarch and tapioca would work best?
