For the bread, I used some plain <a title="how else to use up a loaf?">pandoro</a> and reduced the sugar to about one-third cup. I didn't mix in the unabsorbed alcohol, and just spooned out the macerated fruit. The whole thing was baked for about 70 minutes in a larger baking dish instead of individual ramekins. The pudding is divine: nice <a href="http://www.presidentschoice.ca/FoodAndRecipes/GreatFood/ProductDetails.aspx/id/2439/name/PCBittersweetRichDarkChocolate/catid/193">chocolate</a>  flavour, good balance with the dried fruit, and warmth from the brandy (the fruit soaked up two-thirds of it).
