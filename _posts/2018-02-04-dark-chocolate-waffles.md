What makes something a breakfast food, or a snack food only, or suitable for
dinner, but not for lunch? Cultural norms? Family tradition? Advertising? 
Nutrition? On Sunday, some of those questions went through my head while eating 
these chocolate "waffles".

Let's be honest: this [recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/dark-chocolate-waffles)
from Bon Appetit is really just **grid-shaped brownies**. Olive oil, eggs, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, 
etc. There's a bit more effort involved in this breakfast treat though, as you have to 
chop chocolate, and whip egg whites. But, if you like dessert for breakfast, it's worth 
it! Pro-tip: I completely **omitted** the brown sugar and no one noticed.
