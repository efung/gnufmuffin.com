For an early Thanksgiving dinner celebration, I wanted to make an easy, warm
dessert, and this month's cooking magazine suggested something I've
never made before: an apple betty.

The [recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/14141-apple-blackberry-betty)
comes from the Sept/Oct 2021 issue of Cook's Illustrated. You might ask,
what is the difference between a crisp and a betty? Well, the defining
feature of the latter, is fresh bread crumbs forming the base, as well as
the topping.

Following a suggestion in the article, I used slices of an old challah I had in
the freezer. This enriched, sweet bread contributed its own sweetness and
richness to the crumb mixture, which also had sugar, and melted butter
blitzed into it. I also stuck with the suggested fruit, a mix of apples
and blackberries.

Unfortunately, during baking, I misread the directions and
baked the betty for the entire time on the upper rack, instead of the bottom.
This might have contributed to the firmness of the apples, not the
"luxuriously soft" texture promised in the recipe. Or, it might have been
the apple varieties I used, since I had no idea what they were.

My family didn't really enjoy this: some complained about the softness of the
bread, some complained about the blackberries. I think I would try it making it again
in the future, using plain sandwich bread to cut down on sweetness, and the right 
apples that will turn soft when baked.
