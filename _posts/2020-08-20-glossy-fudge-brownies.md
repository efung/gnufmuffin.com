For an outdoor get-together, I decided to offer up some brownies, as they're
a crowd pleaser. I'm pretty blasÃ© about these often one-note treats: too sweet, 
too dry, too fudgy. But after a recent [purchase](https://www.madamegateaux.ca/pages/specialty-baking-ingredients)
of [high-fat (22%) Dutch cocoa powder](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/12/best-dutch-cocoas.html),
I decided to try Stella Parks' take on this iconic American dessert.

Her [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/02/print/bravetart-glossy-fudge-brownies.html) 
is loaded with flavour enhancers: browned butter, instant espresso, dark chocolate, the
aformentioned cocoa powder, and vanilla. It took a long time for me to brown the butter in a
3-qt saucier: it foamed for a really long time before I could start to see the browned bits.
It also meant that my melted butter was quite hot when I needed to add it to the batter.

I needed the full 30 minutes before the brownies were fully done. Having a target internal
temperature makes it very easy to know when these are done. Right out of the oven, they
were quite puffy, but the middle fell a bit during cooling. As promised, these had a 
glossy, thin crust on top.

Wow wow wow ðŸ˜²! Were these ever delicious, even for someone who always thought he liked
the cakey kind better. Even after two days at room temperature in a very loosely covered pan,
these chocolate squares stayed moist. The flavour is intense, with the texture striking 
just the right balance between gooey and messy. Twenty-four squares is the suggested 
portioning, but I think slightly smaller pieces would be fine. I couldn't detect the 
contribution of the browned butter, so maybe I'd skip that laborious process next time.
