One thing that amused me in the recipe is the line about using a good maple syrup; the authors say the real stuff has a maple leaf on the container. I used Canada #2 Amber. Instead of using plain chopped pecans, I made a half batch of maple sugared pecans following a recipe from <span style="font-style:italic;">In the Sweet Kitchen</span>. Very tasty with great maple flavour, with none of the grittiness often found in commercial ice creams.

The fruit grinds fine enough that it slipped through the holes of my strainer. The texture is a little gritty. But the flavour is there and that's what matters.
