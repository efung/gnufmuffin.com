Seeing combinations of flavours that I haven't tried before gets me really excited.
This chocolate-sesame brownie certainly made my tastebuds tingle, and was exactly
the kind of dessert I knew I could expect from the new dessert book from Yotam Ottolenghi.

The [recipe](https://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/tahini-and-halva-brownies) is from 
[Sweet](/tag/sweet-%28ottolenghi%29/). It's similar to most other brownie recipes
in directing you to melt chocolate and butter together, whipping eggs and sugar
to a light foam, then combining everything together with the dry ingredients.

Where it deviates from the norm, is in adding chunks of [halvah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halva) to the batter,
as well as drizzling tahini on the surface. I used a plain sesame halvah bought at a Middle Eastern
grocer ([Marché Adonis](http://groupeadonis.ca/en/ontario/), for those of you in the Greater Toronto
or Montréal areas). The ground sesame paste on top surprised me: the oil was absorbed into the batter, 
and left behind a firm nut paste, not at all runny. I baked these brownies in an 8" brownie pan, and 
needed 27 minutes before a toothpick inserted in the centre wasn't wet.

More than one person commented that the brownies had a peanut smell when they came out of the oven.
I did cut back on the sugar somewhat, but these still tasted rich to me, full of deep chocolate flavour
and the occasional bite of crumbly sesame candy. Next time, I would experiment with slightly shorter baking time,
and aiming for a less cakey texture.
