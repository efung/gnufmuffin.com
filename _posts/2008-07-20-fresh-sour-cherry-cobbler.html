I bought a basket at St. Lawrence Market for $15 and this yielded exactly 4 pounds. It took about a half hour to manually pit all the cherries (just squeezing the pit out, no fancy tool required); this is the most labour-intensive part of the recipe. The biscuit dough is very simple to make and turns out cobblers that are very delicate and light. Red wine (I used a Baco Noir) really complements the cherries and deepens the colour. I must not have boiled the macerating liquid long enough because it was still quite runny when it was time to serve this dessert. This recipe is quite streamlined because you can make the biscuit topping while the cherries are macerating, and thickening the liquid on the stove means it only needs 10 more minutes to bake after it's assembled. A very delicious dessert, especially eaten warm.<br /><br />Jamie took another <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jbcurio/2684567302/">photo</a>.
