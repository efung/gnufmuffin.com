Sometimes kids surprise you, like when my son asked for ice cream
sandwiches for his birthday instead of a cake. We obliged, of course,
and I made an incredibly rich and delicious treat, enjoyed by both 
young and old.

The [recipes](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/06/fudge-cookie-ice-cream-sandwiches-recipe.html)
are from Emily Luchetti's [A Passion For Ice
Cream](/tag/a-passion-for-ice-cream/). The cookie dough contains
a _lot_ of chocolate, which accounts for their chewy, fudgy texture.
As a tip to my future self, don't make these so big, as they're
dense and heavy, and each sandwich will have two of them. The
recipe says you should aim for 20 cookies, but I made about 15 or so.

As for the ice cream, make sure you heed the quantity of mint (Â¾
cup packed), as it's essential to get a good mint flavour. If you
can find peppermint, so much the better. I find that most mints in
the grocery are some type of spearmint, which doesn't contain
menthol, which produces that cooling feeling we associate with
mint-flavoured candies.

For easier assembly, I took the freshly spun ice cream and poured 
it into two plastic wrap-lined square baking pans, to a depth of about
one inch. That way, after it froze completely, I could lift out the
layer, and use a cutter to form nice circles of ice cream to
put between two cookies.
