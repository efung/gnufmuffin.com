I made a layer cake using two 9" pans (the linked recipe has been modified from the original), covering it with plain cream cheese frosting (caramel would be overkill). As my parsnips were old and starting to dry out in the fridge, they didn't really caramelize in the oven. To get a nice smooth mash, I pureed them with a hand blender, adding some of the pear juice to hydrate them. I love fruit and nuts in my carrot cakes, so I was pleased with this &ldquo;white &rdquo; carrot cake's inclusion of canned pears, pecans and coconut. Since Dr. S was taking this to work, I didn't get a chance to sample it, but I'm told it was very well received. Who says you can't enjoy parsnips?
