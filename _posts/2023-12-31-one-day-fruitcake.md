Since my Mom died, I haven't felt as much urgency to make fruitcake for
the holidays. I made sure to share whatever I baked with her each year. 
So it's somewhat of an annual tradition. I saw this Claire Saffitz
[recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023686-one-day-fruitcake) 
on YouTube and was intrigued by the idea of mixing in almond paste into 
the batter so spent some time getting all the ingredients.

I actually tried to find a good quality almond paste, one that is
upwards of 50% almonds (rather than marzipan, which can be as low
as 25%). However, I struck out at my usual stores, and just settled
for the sugary stuff.

While, technically, you can start this cake and eat it within a 24-hour
period, from a practical perspective, you'd probably do it over two or
even three days. On the first day, I soaked the dried fruit (exactly as
called for in the recipe: cherries, apricots, prunes, cranberries, 
currants) in a mix of fresh orange juice and bourbon.

The next day, I made the cake, substituting some of the marzipan with
ground almonds. When the Bundt pan came out of the oven, I used more 
bourbon to soak the warm cake. Finally, I brushed it, as directed, 
with strained apricot jam. Since I was in no hurry, I made the icing
a few days later.

The jam glaze and icing aren't something that I would normally
embellish a fruitcake with. I do admit that it makes it look quite
beautiful though.

And the taste: this is a very good fruitcake, a nice balance of
ingredients and flavours. I expected a stronger almond flavour but
couldn't really detect it. I've left nice cake dome out for
almost a week, enjoying a slice each day but will have to freeze
the extras soon.
