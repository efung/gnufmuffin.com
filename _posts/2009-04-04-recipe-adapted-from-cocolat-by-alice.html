I found a charlotte recipe that sounded good and adapted it to incorporate to use white chocolate instead of dark. These types of desserts are visually quite stunning so I knew it would be a crowd pleaser. The ladyfinger batter makes exactly enough for an 8" mold, so I was barely able to extend the recipe to fit in my 8&frac34;" cake ring. Next, I prepared the bananas (double quantity for increased flavour) and soaked them in the rum syrup. To make the mousse, I omitted the espresso dissolved in water and used the full twelve ounces of chocolate. At this point, I put the almost-complete charlotte in the fridge under a cake dome. On the evening of the party, we whipped cream and piped it on top, sprinkling a bit of cocoa powder on top to allow the rosettes to show. This was very, very tasty: the moist cake enveloped a highly perfumed mousse full of rum and banana flavours. I would definitely make this again.
