excerpt: "Looking back at this blog, I\'ve made five different blueberry muffins before, and I already have two favourite recipes. This week, I made one batch of one kind and another of this recipe from BakeWise. It\'s from the section where she goes on about how whipped cream makes everything rich and tasty."

This week, I made one batch of <a href="http://gnufmuffin.blogspot.com/2005/08/wild-blueberry-buttermilk-cinnamon.html">one kind</a> and another of this recipe from BakeWise. It's from the section where she goes on about how whipped cream makes everything rich and tasty. Corriher also warns that the batter is very moist and tender, and that you can't overbeat it. I found that these muffins were true to her word, but that the texture was too wet and loose for my liking. Also, they were too sweet. I'll pass on this recipe.
