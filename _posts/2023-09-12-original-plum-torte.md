Our two plum trees fared pretty well this year. This summer, I
bought a [tree pruning kit](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/garden/garden-care/sets/111307-complete-pruning-kit?item=AB327), and gave
our red plum a good trim. Each fruit was larger than in
previous years, but the harvest was modest. However, the Italian
blue plum tree, which I did not prune, produced a LOT of fruit.

Instead of making the [plum pound cake](/2005/10/plum-and-cardamom-sweet-bread.html) which I typically do every year, I turned to another
tried and true [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/3783-original-plum-torte) from the New York Times.

This one can't be easier: just creaming butter and sugar, then beating 
in eggs, flour, and baking powder. Top with cut plums, lemon juice,
cinnamon and sugar. Bake. Enjoy.

We liked this so much that I made it over and over again during the
month. One time I used cardamom instead of cinnamon. Another time, I
overbaked it. If you watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1qpZWkrQMA), there's ideas for more variations. It doesn't really matter.
This cake really is foolproof, easy, and delicious. Just don't skimp
on the plums, they shrink and fall under the puffy batter so try to
cover the entire surface with fruit.
