I also had a large quantity of Philadelphia cream cheese so I was all set to try out a recipe from this newly purchased cookbook. Several notes about the recipe itself: the linked recipe is in Imperial by volume. In my copy (maybe a UK edition?), they're in metric by weight (much better). Also, this is not the same recipe as the one from <span style="font-style:italic;">How To Be a Domestic Goddess</span> but it's close. If you want to watch her make it, the episode from her TV show is on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_578Uk8y2aM">YouTube</a>. Note that she is pretty sloppy with the mixing, and I'm surprised it turns out so smooth. I scraped down constantly and added ingredients one at a time, and still got a few lumps. I used a cheesecake tin with a removable bottom and didn't bother to wrap it with foil. Instead of a roasting pan, I used a very large pie plate for the water bath. This worked out well, without any water leakage. The baked cheesecake pulled away from the buttered sides of the tin without any assistance from me. My only criticism of this recipe is that the chocolate sauce separates easily after being reheated; plain melted chocolate would have worked just as well. This was very tasty, not overly sweet and went quite quickly at the office.
