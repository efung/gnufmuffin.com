excerpt: "In looking for 2009's fruitcake, I wanted one that featured lots of nuts and dried fruit, with none of the candied pineapple and cherries that most include. In years past, I've made recipes that included olives, applesauce, one from Alton Brown, a delicious cashew-based one from Regan Daley, and several"

In years past, I've made recipes that included <a href="/2007/12/fruitcake-to-love.html">olives</a>, <a href="/2006/12/applesauce-fruitcake.html">applesauce</a>, one from <a href="/2006/11/free-range-fruitcake.html">Alton Brown</a>, a delicious cashew-based one from <a href="/2005/12/golden-new-fashioned-dried-fruitcake.html">Regan Daley</a>, and several from the LCBO's Food and Drink magazine. I took the opportunity to make my own candied orange peel and it really does taste far better than store-bought. To add variety, I used pecans and walnuts, as well as whole almonds, toasting all of them first to enhance their nuttiness. The cake turned out fairly dense and was a little dry, so I would soak the dried fruit in additional brandy if I made this again.
