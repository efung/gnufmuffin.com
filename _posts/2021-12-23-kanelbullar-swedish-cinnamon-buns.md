Have you noticed Cook's Illustrated has more colour pages, and has started
to let their writers explore more culinary traditions? It's happened
slowly, and I like the increased variety in every issue. With [hygge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge)
and [fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_culture#Sweden) popping
up everywhere online recently, I wasn't surprised that the
magazine featured a Swedish pastry eaten with coffee.

_Kanelbullar_ is a Swedish version of a cinnamon bun, incorporating fragrant cardamom 
into the dough. The [recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/14294-kanelbullar-swedish-cinnamon-buns)
is from the magazine's Jan/Feb 2022 issue.

To get the strongest cardamom flavour possible, the directions encourage you
to grind the powder from pods yourself. Even though I think my
ground cardamom (from an Indian grocery) is plenty potent, my
daughter and I plucked the brown and black seeds out by hand, then
pulsed them in our spice mill until it resembled coarse black pepper.

One non-traditional component in this recipe is the use of flour paste,
made by microwaving milk and flour. This _tangzhong_ technique has shown
up previously in the magazine's [challah](/2020/04/easy-braid-challah-cooks-illustrated.html)
and other baked goods. This helps to make the dough moist but still easy to
work with. What I found a bit annoying is that the dough chills in a 9x13" pan,
which isn't used to bake the buns later. Because it's really sticky, I needed
a plastic bench scraper to remove all of it from the pan.

My filling mixture was a bit too cold to spread easily, so I used my fingertips
to smush it around and try to coat every bit of dough. Shaping these buns required
a bit of practise, but got easier after the first few. I skipped the topping
because I didn't have any coarse sugar of any kind on hand.

Fresh out of the oven, these were absolutely amazing. The cardamom in the dough made 
these buns much _much_ more interesting than regular cinnamon buns. And I like that the
cinnamon sugar filling wasn't too sweet. I don't think the pearl sugar is a requirement
unless you're aiming to replicate the traditional look. Highly recommended.
