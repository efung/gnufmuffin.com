excerpt: "We cut back this year and only took home 28 lbs of apples from the orchard. For a different treat, I tried making this two-fruit crumble pie. Using jarred sour cherries (purchased at Fresh From the Farm), I mixed the filling and made the crumble topping fairly quickly. I really like the addition of almonds"

For a different treat, I tried making this two-fruit crumble pie. Using jarred sour cherries (purchased at <a href="http://www.freshfromthefarm.ca/">Fresh From the Farm</a>), I mixed the filling and made the crumble topping fairly quickly. I really like the addition of almonds into the crumble, as well as sliced nuts on the top which toast as the pie bakes. Unfortunately, the crumble was the best part. I found that the apples didn't cook through and that the filling wasn't cohesive (there isn't any thickener in the recipe). More and more, I'm preferring pies made with partially cooked apples, so I think that would be an improvement on this recipe too.
