He dislikes soggy crust bottoms, so I knew right away to try the crisp crust variation. The recipe in the link above is Kimball's regular pie dough recipe. His version for prebaked pie shells (what I followed) uses 2 tablespoons less butter; he says this is to ensure the edging on the pie remains distinct after prebaking. The filling was still sloshing around after 15 minutes, so I covered the top with foil, lowered the heat and baked for another 15 minutes. True to its name, the crust is definitely crisp, almost cracker-like but the top of the filling has started to caramelize due to the extended baking. Very tasty, especially the bourbon/rum/vanilla flavour.
