It's been a while since I've participated in this <a href="http://domesticgoddess.ca/pages.php?page=10002">event</a> but I thought I would take part in the <a href="http://creampuffsinvenice.ca/2007/09/04/shf-35-the-beautiful-fig/">fig</a> edition that Ivonne is hosting.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/1427751875/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1408/1427751875_0540f1d7f2_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" class="inlineleft" alt="Pear and Fig Charlotte (1)" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/1428626592/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1326/1428626592_e2c9da2a15_t.jpg" width="100" height="72" class="inlineleft" alt="Pear and Fig Charlotte (2)" /></a>My entry is a charlotte made with pears and figs from a <a href="http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=190699">recipe</a> found in <span style="font-style:italic;">Desserts by Pierre Hermé</span> by Dorie Greenspan. The cake recipes in this book tend to be lengthy, multi-step affairs so I split up the task over several days. Earlier in the week, I prepared the canned pears by submerging them in a mixture of simple syrup, lemon juice and a vanilla bean. Next, I soaked the dried figs in boiling water to soften them. I drained them after a day in the fridge so that they wouldn't lose all of their flavour. The liquor store did not have any <a href="http://www.ochef.com/251.htm">poire william</a> and I didn't want to buy any artificial pear vodka or liquor so I settled for making the soaking syrup using pear nectar combined with plain vodka. For the poire william cream, the recipe calls for making a bavarian cream flavoured with a purée of the pears and pear brandy (I substituted with apple brandy).<br /><br />Charlottes are usually made with ladyfingers and these little piped cakes gave me trouble. I ran into the same problem that I encountered <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2006/05/crispy-and-creamy-rice-treat.html">last time</a>: the ladyfingers browned before they were fully baked. After discarding this batch, I tried making the recipe from the Art of Cakes <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2005/11/cake-8-tiramis.html">tiramisù class</a>. I piped the fingers much thicker, and reduced the oven temperature to about 400&deg;F. These turned out better, but still looked deflated as they cooled.<br /><br />Once all the components are made, assembly is easy, of course. Fit the ladyfinger band around the sides of a cake ring and place the disc in the bottom. Brush with the soaking syrup, fill halfway with the cream, then cover with the chopped dried figs and vanilla-infused pears. Pour the remaining cream over and top with the other ladyfinger disc. Garnish with sliced fresh figs and more pears.<br /><br />We took this to a park by the lake and served it <span style="font-style:italic;">al fresco</span> on a picnic bench. My relatives devoured it in record time. The pear flavour is wonderful and the tiny seeds of the figs provide a nice surprise. In this charlotte, figs had a secondary, but important supporting role, but it is a testament to M. Hermé's genius to be able to creatively combine and highlight flavours and textures.
