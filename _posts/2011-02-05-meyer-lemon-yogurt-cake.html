I hadn't heard of it before but was looking for something to use up yogurt and lemons. This was very easy to put together and required just stirring all the ingredients together. Adding the oil at the last step was a bit of a worry because I felt I might overmix the batter and make a tough cake. In the end, it wasn't too bad: light texture, but slightly overmixed. I made the lemon syrup to drizzle over top but omitted the icing. Instead, I used a mandoline to slice some Meyer lemons and candied them in a little simple syrup. An interesting thing happened when the bubbling mixture cooled down: it gelled! All of those lemon seeds must have released their pectin.
