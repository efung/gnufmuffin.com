excerpt: "For an early Hanukkah party we were co-hosting, I volunteered to make a deep-fried dessert. To ensure that all the adults and kids would have enough, we decided to make a double-batch of the dough. It's quite sticky after rolling, so make sure you flour the counter heavily. I brushed the entire surface"

To ensure that all the adults and kids would have enough, we decided to make a double-batch of the dough. It's quite sticky after rolling, so make sure you flour the counter heavily. I brushed the entire surface of each round with egg white, then dropped spoonfuls of sour cherry or blueberry jam onto them, before making little sandwiches.<br /><br />Using an enamelled cast-iron pot, I heated about 3 inches of a mix of sunflower and canola oil over our gas stove, and checked the temperature with my super-accurate Thermapen. There was no problem in holding the temperature steady at around 360&deg;F. Some of the donuts puffed up spectacularly into almost spherical shapes. A minute on each side was enough to get them golden brown. After draining on paper towels, I tossed each one in a bowl of granulated sugar.<br /><br />These came out quite bread-like, not the cakey kind you get at <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/menu/donuts.html">Tim Horton's</a>. But eaten fresh at the party, less than an hour after they left the hot oil, they were heavenly. We couldn't stop eating them. I &#x2764; deep frying!
