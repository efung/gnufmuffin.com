The authors call for freezing both the chips and fruit beforehand, presumably so they will not melt or get crushed during the gentle kneading of the dough. I used the smallest Bala cranberries from a basket bought at the farmer's market, and PC Decadent chocolate chips. In the ingredient list, 5 cups of flour are called for, but only 3 &frac12; cups are specified in the directions. I used &frac12; cup during kneading. The sweet buns aren't actually all that sweet, a bit more sugar would have been better.
