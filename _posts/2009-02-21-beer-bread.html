The use of beer for the liquid sounded interesting, and I used a bottle of light ale that I had on hand instead of a dark beer the recipe called for. One crucial step I forgot was adding the salt: it's supposed to be added after a rest period. This bread turned out quite spongy with a fine crumb. The crisp, chewy crust gave way to a noticeably sweet interior. I might make this again if I had some leftover beer (!) but it's nothing special.
