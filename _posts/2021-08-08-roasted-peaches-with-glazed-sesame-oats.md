It's no secret that one of our favourite market vendors is [Bizjak Farms](http://www.bizjakfarms.com/).
I've written about their wonderful stone fruit before. Still, the quality varies from
year to year, even week to week. A recent haul of peaches from the 
[Wychwood Barns Farmers' Market](https://www.thestop.org/farmers-market/) left us
underwhelmed, owing to one basket's mealy texture. However, a 20-minute roast
transformed the lacklustre fruit into something much tastier.

The [recipe](http://breannasrecipebox.blogspot.com/2015/08/roasted-peaches-with-glazed-sesame-oats.html) comes from 
[Seven Spoons](/tag/seven-spoons/), a cookbook by [Tara O'Brady](https://www.taraobrady.com/).
At its core, the basic idea of this recipe is roasted peaches and granola atop yogurt. And it's easy to
adapt to other fruit, different diary (maybe ricotta or quark), and even store-bought oat cereal.
But when the headnote of this recipe describes the oats as being coated in a "_sesame seed-studded shellac_",
I couldn't resist making O'Brady's version.

I used a toaster oven for the fruit, and was thrilled that roasting my mediocre peaches made them 
more delicious, with a yielding texture that wasn't mushy. I skipped the five-spice powder on the fruit,
in deference to my wife and daughter, who aren't fans of it. One bonus was that the skins were easy to slip off
the peach halves. The granola had a wonderful sesame flavour, and had just the right amount of sweet from the
maple syrup and brown sugar. It held in an airtight container for a week.

Highly recommended for breakfast,  post-lunch dessert, or midnight snack!
