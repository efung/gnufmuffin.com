Even though I didn't use a non-stick pan, there was no problem inverting the pancake onto a plate. I used a mix of whipping cream and 2% milk in place of half-and-half, making it a bit richer. The method is very hands-off aside from cooking the apples, and much easier than flipping a whole stack of pancakes. Lots of apples to contrast with the eggy pancake. Definitely something I should make more often.
