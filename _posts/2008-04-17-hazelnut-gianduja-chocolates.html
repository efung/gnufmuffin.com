Yesterday morning, I tempered a batch of milk and dark chocolate, then used the former to stipple the molds, and the latter for coating. I did this sequentially which turned out to be a mistake: Greweling specifically says not to let the chocolate crystallize before adding the coating. This morning, I liquified some toasted, skinned hazelnuts (it takes about 5 minutes of food processing), then combined it with an equal weight of icing sugar, and a bit more melted chocolate. In the end, I had made... Nutella! I piped the soft filling into the molds, then went to work. In the evening, I tempered dark chocolate for the bottoms. As I suspected, the marble effect came out quite ugly and there are visible cocoa butter crystals which hindered easy release of the chocolates. Still, the gianduja is quite tasty, even if the appearance is lacking.
