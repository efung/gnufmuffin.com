It's unbaked when the filling goes in, so it comes it soft and tender. I hadn't used redcurrants before and found the raw fruit to be very acidic, so I only used about 200g in the filling instead of the full 250g. It goes in Pepto-Bismol pink and comes out darker, like blood-orange. As it uses cornstarch, the texture is a bit pasty. Flavour-wise, it's a bit like cranberry (without the tannins). Good comments from all the tasters at the potluck I went to.
