Continuing through the _Fabulous Modern Cookies_ cookbook,
I thought the flavour idea of **jam and bread** to be an interesting 
one. These cookies were well-received, and their panko coating
was something I had never tried before.

Instead of using a skillet to toast the panko as directed in the
[recipe](https://www.foodgal.com/2022/05/cookies-that-taste-like-marmalade-toast/), 
I put a tray in the oven while it was preheating. For the jam, I used
the last jar of [Seville orange marmalade](/2022/02/seville-orange-marmalade.html) I made last year, using kitchen shears to snip up 
the chunks of peel.

I didn't really get a strong toast _flavour_ from these, but
rolling the cookies in crumbs provided the _texture_ of toast. These
won't win any awards, but I think they would be perfect as part of 
a cookie assortment.
