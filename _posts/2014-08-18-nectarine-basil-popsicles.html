<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/14792577279" title="Nectarine Basil Popsicle by Eric Fung, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3906/14792577279_04ca696b44_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Nectarine Basil Popsicle"></a><br />Stone fruit, especially nectarines and peaches, have a very short shelf life. After getting them from the market stand, they start to deteriorate rapidly, attracting fruit flies and mold within a few days. After holding a basket of overripe nectarines in the fridge for a few days, I decided to try turning them into popsicles.<br /> <br /><a name='more'></a>Some time ago, Flick bought a <a href="http://peoplespops.bigcartel.com/product/people-s-pops-cookbook">recipe book</a> that was full of interesting popsicle flavour combinations, made using local, seasonal fruit. And on our trip to New York City last October, we happened to <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/10259561093/">try</a> some of the creations of the folks at <a href="http://www.peoplespops.com/peoples_pops.html">People's Pops</a> at <a href="http://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a>. Flipping through the book, I found several combinations including peach or nectarine, all of which sounded amazing.<br /><br />The <a href="http://folder-o.blogspot.ca/2013/07/roasted-nectarine-and-basil-ice-pops.html">recipe</a> I used is pretty simple: roast the nectarines in the oven until they're soft, then pur√©e them with simple syrup infused with basil and a bit of lemon juice. I didn't run the blender for an extended period, choosing to allow a few bits of skin and fruit to remain. The popsicles taste intensely of nectarine (duh), with a just a faint, herbal undertone. I would prefer a little more tartness, and would reduce the simple syrup by a &frac14; cup or so next time.
