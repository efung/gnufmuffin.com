excerpt: "Frozen cranberries and a bunch of tiny not-so-sweet mandarins were the key ingredients for this loaf. I squeezed many of the little citrus fruits to get the required amount of juice, but used a regular orange for the zest. The only other substitution was yogurt and milk for the buttermilk. This loaf"

I squeezed many of the little citrus fruits to get the required amount of juice, but used a regular orange for the zest. The only other substitution was yogurt and milk for the buttermilk. This loaf was pretty good, not hard to make, and delivered tanginess and crunchiness.
