excerpt: "During a recent walk around Kensington Market, I wasn\'t able to find any Ontario apricots and thought that the season was over. Last Friday, Square One\'s Farmer\'s Market yielded numerous vendors selling what I was looking for, and I bought a giant basket. Unfortunately, many of these were past prime,"

Last Friday, Square One's Farmer's Market yielded numerous vendors selling what I was looking for, and I bought a giant basket. Unfortunately, many of these were past prime, beginning to brown and get moldy. I salvaged as many as I could, processing them briefly in a food processor, then combining about 5 cups of fruit with the rest of a jar of candied ginger puree, about 3 tbsp. Since I was using no-sugar pectin, I added 1 &frac12; cups of raw cane sugar for a slightly darker colour and sweeter taste. The consistency came out just right, not firm, but not runny either. There is a distinctive gingery bite which is a great complement for the stone fruit. I really enjoy the deeper orange colour and flavour of apricots compared to peaches!
