My preference is for a style of brownie that is somewhere in the middle on the fudgey-cakey spectrum. I made a double batch of the recipe as written, in two separate 8" square tins, but only one batch of frosting. I simplified the ganache by just using semisweet chocolate, and not bothering to whip it. You really do need to frost these when the brownies are totally cooled, or else the ganache will melt and won't adhere to the tops. There was barely enough frosting for all the brownies, but just enough so you got a taste of that coffee and chocolate. I quite liked these little snacks (as did my coworkers) despite them being more on the fudgey side. The balance of sweet and bitter is quite nice.
