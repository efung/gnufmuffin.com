We were also invited to dinner this weekend as well, so this recipe yielding 22 cupcakes fit the bill. Dr. S browsed through the book and narrowed the choices down, but ultimately selected this peanut-butter-based cupcake recipe. I messed up reading the recipe and combined the peanut butter and sour cream together, mixing it in near the end. My yield was actually 24 medium-sized cupcakes. They baked up fine, perhaps a little dry; I'm still figuring out the adjustment to use for our convection oven. I only made a half-batch of the frosting, and piped a ring of it on top of the cupcakes, then put a dollop of grape jam in the centre.<br /><br />These were very, very tasty on the first day, but they got denser and drier after a few days in the fridge. As with a lot of the other recipes in this book, the cupcakes are quite rich. This recipe has butter, peanut butter, sour cream, cream cheese and heavy cream in it!<br /><br />Interestingly, <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/peanut-butter-cupcakes-with-peanut-butter-frosting-and-jelly">Stewart's website</a> has this recipe with a few modifications: it omits the chopped peanuts, and notes the yield as 18 cupcakes.
