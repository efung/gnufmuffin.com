Fall brings apples, and every year at this time, I look for ways
to use the fruit that we pick from the orchard ($90 worth this
time!). Besides pies and crisps, which I make every year, I wanted 
to concentrate some of the apples into a spreadable butter.

There's no dairy in apple butter, so it refers to the
consistency, something that can be smeared with a knife.
I used a 
[recipe](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/sweet-and-chunky-apple-butter-230706)
from [_The Complete Book of Small-Batch
Preserving_](http://www.fireflybooks.com/index.php/catalogue/adult-books/product/9079-the-complete-book-of-small-batch-preserving-over-300-recipes-to-use-year-round). First, I didn't use the varieties
it calls for (McIntosh and Granny Smith): I used what my family picked which were
Gala (aromatic and sweet) and Cortland (pale, holds its shape). This
particular recipe calls for first cooking the apples in cider, then adding sugar
and cooking them for another half hour.

I found this to be a time-consuming way to make apple butter. After
about 90 minutes, which was a half hour longer than the recipe
prescribes, my mixture finally started to get darker and thicken,
but I didn't want to wait any longer. The next morning, after the
apple mixture had chilled, it resembled regular yogurt in texture,
thicker than applesauce, but not as thick as soft butter. A few
chunks of apple (presumably the Cortlands) remained.

In the (very near) future, I want to try a more hands-free technique,
namely cooking the apples in the oven or slow cooker.
