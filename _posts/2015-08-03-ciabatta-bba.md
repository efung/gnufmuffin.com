For the Civic Holiday Monday, we were invited for dinner and wanted to
bring something to go with a nice goat cheese spread we bought at a
farmer's market. I took the opportunity to make the ciabatta from 
the book I learned to bake bread from.

Peter Reinhart's [The Bread Bakers
Apprentice](/tag/The%20Bread%20Bakers%20Apprentice/) is full of
information, photos and recipes and I consider it an essential reference
for bread. The ciabatta
[recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1x4uh0/ciabatta_from_peter_reinharts_bread_bakers/)
employs a [pre-ferment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-ferment) in the 
form of a poolish, a wet sponge. I made it at 23:00 on Sunday night, and
had my brother-in-law put it in the fridge around 03:00.

The next morning, I combined the poolish with the rest of the
ingredients. As the dough came together in the mixer, I knew it seemed a
little dry. The recipe says it should clear the sides of the bowl but
stick to the bottom, but mine cleared the bottom also. I dribbled in a
few tablespoons of water, but the dough resisted becoming tacky.

I proceeded to stretch and fold and rest, and after two hours, the dough
was ready to shape and go into the oven. For dusting the peel, I used
semolina flour. The loaves were a bit too plump, but as I tried to stretch 
them, they started to crack so I let it go.

With a heavy brownie pan in the oven as my steam pan, I poured in a cup
of boiling water, and did three rounds of spritzing. This "water dance"
paid off, as it produced a beautiful, deeply browned, crisp crust.

Eaten a few hours after it came out of the oven, the bread was
delicious. Lots of chew at the edges, with a soft, tender crumb. You can
see that I didn't achieve those big, open holes that are a signature of 
properly made ciabatta. For example, my [previous
effort](/2010/01/ciabatta.html) based on a Cook's Illustrated recipe
turned out beautifully. But I trust Reinhart's recipe and advice, and
will try it again in the future, adjusting the hydration level even
higher.
