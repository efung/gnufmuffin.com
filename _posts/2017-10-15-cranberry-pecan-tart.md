Fresh cranberries paired with pecans in a sweet gooey filling, made this
fall tart an instant hit at Sunday dinner. It wasn't difficult to make
and everything came together quite quickly. Of course, discovering a disc 
of frozen tart dough in the freezer certainly helped.

The recipe is from Flo Braker's [The Simple Art of Perfect Baking](/tag/the-simple-art-of-perfect-baking/).
The berries are gently cooked in a light caramel, then the eggs are whisked in,
before being poured into a partially blind-baked shell. That's pretty much it.
It goes into the oven until the filling is bubbling, and just set.

Each slice of this dessert isn't substantial, but each bite has a bit of soft, tart
cranberry and a nugget of pecan and is quite satisfying. The orange zest really helps to 
round out the flavour, so don't omit it.
