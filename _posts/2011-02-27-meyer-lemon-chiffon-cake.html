excerpt: "I\'ve never had fresh yuzu before. Every so often, the zest will show up as a garnish in a cup of chawan mushi or atop a bowl of chirashi in a restaurant, but I\'ve never thought to ask where the chefs got it from.

Every so often, the zest will show up as a garnish in a cup of <i>chawan mushi</i> or atop a bowl of <i>chirashi</i> in a restaurant, but I've never thought to ask where the chefs got it from. This recipe comes from an independent coffee chain in the States, one which I've actually been to this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/sets/72157624309668223/">past summer</a>. On our visit to New York, we stayed with friends in Brooklyn and they took us to the <a href="http://www.bluebottlecoffee.net/locations/berry-st-brooklyn/">Berry St.</a> outlet where I recall having a very black, bitter and unusual tasting coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, I followed the suggestion in the recipe to use Meyer lemons as a substitute for the elusive yuzu. I pretty much followed the recipe verbatim, except I greased and floured the pan so it would be easy to ummold, especially from the bottom. It shrunk quite a bit after cooling and it wasn't a problem to invert and slice.<br /><br />The cake has a cool mouth-feel and a distinct, lemony taste. I found it to be a little too springy and have too much "bite". That could be the result of overmixing or overbeating the whites.
