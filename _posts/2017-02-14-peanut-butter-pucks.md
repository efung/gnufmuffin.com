Valentine's Day is also known as "House-i-versary" for us, the day
we moved into our home. We don't usually go out or get each other
anything, but looking [back](/archives/) at what I've made in
previous years, it's clear that something [chocolatey](/tag/chocolate/)
was needed. These Reese's peanut butter cup knock-offs contain just
two ingredients, and were easy enough to make on a weeknight after
dinner.

The recipe comes from Michael Recchiuti and Fran Gage's book, [_Chocolate Obsession_](https://www.recchiuti.com/chocolateobsession.html). After tempering
some dark chocolate, you paint that onto the inside of several silicone muffin liners. If you're using
paper, you double them up, so the mold is more rigid. I used a mix of both mini and small liners. Do
ensure that you build up a nice thick layer, especially near the top.

Once the liners are made and set, you combine melted chocolate with
peanut butter (roughly 50:50), stirring until the mixture is smooth
and cool enough that it won't melt the molds when they're filled.
Then, the pucks go in the fridge until the filling is firm. You
can optionally sprinkle some fleur de sel on top.

I think how much you like these depends a lot on the kind of peanut
butter and chocolate you use. With a 70% cocoa chocolate, and a
natural peanut butter, the overall flavour was harsh, with strong
bittersweet notes.  With a "regular" peanut butter and milk chocolate 
(as called for in the recipe), these would more closely approximate 
the commercial candy flavour.
