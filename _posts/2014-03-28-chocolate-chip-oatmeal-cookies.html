from <span style="font-style: italic;">Cook's Illustrated</span>,
January 1997<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Notes</span>:
I watched the CNBC mini-doc <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOwJ4PXt3GM">"Costco Craze"</a>
recently. It turns out that overspending is a common thing amongst
Costco devotees. From not labelling aisles to having constantly
changing SKUs, the store is designed to get you coming back and
buying things you didn't know you wanted or needed. Case in point:
on my last trip, I bought 5 kg of quick oats. I enjoy a bowl of
porridge for breakfast from time to time, so I thought this was a
great deal. But most baking recipes call for old-fashioned rolled
oats, so my options for taking advantage of this "deal" are limited.<br
/><br />I decided to try out this cookie recipe using a mix of
old-fashioned and quick oats. As you can see from the photo, the
cookies never spread and remained like giant golf balls after baking.
Was this due to the choice of oats? I'm not sure. The cookies aren't
bad, but they're too crumbly, without the satisfying chew from whole
rolled oats. I might try these again, but for a chocolate oatmeal
cookie, <a href="/2005/11/chocolate-chunk-oatmeal-cookies-with.html">this
one</a> is hard to beat.
