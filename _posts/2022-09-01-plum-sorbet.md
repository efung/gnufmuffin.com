One way to enjoy an abundance of fruit is to can it or freeze it. With that in mind,
I roasted two-pound batches of plums, then froze the softened fruit and juice.
This week, I used that to make an easy pure plum sorbet.

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/plum-sorbet-recipe) is from Max Falkowitz
and published in Serious Eats. I followed it pretty closely. Plums have a lot of
fibre and I noticed the puree had a lot of bubbles in it. Don't skip the step
of straining, as no matter how powerful the blender, there's bound to be some
pieces of skin that don't get pulverized.

It's hard to explain, but my initial reaction to the taste of this frozen treat
wasâ€¦ _baby food_. Which might make sense, since the plums were cooked and pureed.
I liked the pure flavour of this sorbet, but would like to try with different types
of plums (Italian blue or damsons) for their colour, and without roasting them first.
