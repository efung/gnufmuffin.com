This past week, I bought a 3L container of peaches from
[T&T](https://www.tnt-supermarket.com/on/) which were unexpectedly
good (I associate this Asian grocer with produce _variety_, more
often than produce _quality_). My family really wanted a pie, but I kept
procrastinating until finally I _had_ to bake something. It turned out
to be a hit with everyone, and was pretty easy to make.

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/08/freeform-peach-pie-galette-recipe.html)
is by Stella Parks, and is technically a galette. On Labour Day, I made the old-fashioned pie 
dough with my 4-year old daughter, satisfyingly squishing the butter cubes by hand. Having
used Kenji Alt's food processor 
[easy pie dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/easy-pie-dough-recipe.html) for 
the past few years, I welcomed the opportunity to make one by hand.

Making and chilling the dough is the most time-consuming part, as the fruit filling is a 
no-brainer: peach chunks tossed with tapioca starch, sugar, and salt. I baked this open-faced 
pie until the glossy crust was golden. My peaches were really ripe, so there was a lot of 
liquid in the centre, making the bottom crust soft and squishy.

No matter though: my whole family had seconds. Some enjoyed the fruit filling, some enjoyed the 
flaky pastry. Stella also notes that you can easily make this galette with other stone fruit, and
it's definitely faster to make than a pie, which requires lining a dish, fluting, latticing, etc.
