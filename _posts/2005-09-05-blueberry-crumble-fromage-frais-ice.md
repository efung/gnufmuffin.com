[Recipe](http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/meals-and-courses/desserts/blueberry-crumble-fromage-frais-ice-cream) adapted from deliaonline.com. _Notes_: Substituted quark (0.25% fat) for fromage frais. Crumble made from pie dough scraps saved up in my freezer, mixed with cinnamon and brown sugar. Very flavourful, lots of textural contrast, a keeper.
