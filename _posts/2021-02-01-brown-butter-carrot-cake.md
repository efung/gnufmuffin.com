Carrots are one of those root vegetables that are sweet enough to
make themselves at home in Dessertville. I've even made 
[carrot sorbet](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2005/10/halloween-ice-creams.html)
before! This week, a carrot cake recipe by Stella Parks caught my eye (as 
do most of her creations). Keep reading for how this 7-pound behemoth turned 
out.

We've been getting Costco grocery deliveries regularly, and a huge
bag of thick orange carrots were languishing in our downstairs fridge.
Enter this [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/10/carrot-cake-recipe.html)
which calls for **two whole pounds** of them. In addition to that
mind-boggling quantity, you also need a **pound** of butter (melted
and browned), more than a **pound** of white and brown sugars, a
**pound** of AP and whole-wheat flours, plus close to a **pound** of toasted
nuts. Plus **one pound** of frosting!

Now, with a cake this enormous, the flavourings are also super-sized: 4 tsps
cinnamon, 4 tsps ground ginger, 1 tbsp vanilla, etc. I made a few
minor substitutions: walnuts instead of pecans, and I cut back
on the sugar by about 10%. Using a stand mixer, the eggs and sugar
get an extended whipping (8 minutes), before the remaining ingredients
are added.

I used two 9" pans, and one 8" pan, so adjusted the weight of batter
portioned into each one accordingly, hoping to achieve an even thickness.
They all baked in about the same amount of time.

For ease of stacking, I did try to level the cakes, but stopped short
of trimming the larger cake circles, nor applying a crumb coat.
(Hey, I'm no cake decorator.)
Also, because BraveTart's [cream cheese buttercream](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/10/cream-cheese-buttercream-recipe.html) 
looked so labour-intensive, I just went with Melissa Clark's
[simpler cream cheese frosting](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015540-cream-cheese-frosting).
But my daughter and I did make the [twisted carrot roses](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/10/carrot-rose-recipe.html)

All of my tasters _**loved**_ this cake. Despite it being too dense for my
liking, and also lacking coconut, pineapple, or raisins, I also thought
it was a very good carrot cake. Plenty of nuts, plenty of flavour.
It's so big, that after eating thin slices for three days, we still managed 
to freeze 9 individually wrapped portions for later.
