We celebrated Chinese New Year this weekend, ahead of the actual
lunar New Year's Day on February 8. As part of our meal,
I wanted to try my hand at a [_tong sui_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_sui) (糖水), 
a Cantonese style of dessert, in particular, an almond sweet soup.

After attending a potluck on Saturday, we hosted our own dinner on
Sunday. We prepared an enormous, homemade meal: scallion pancakes, 
fried vegetable dumplings, steamed shrimp and chive dumplings, [Buddha's
delight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha%27s_delight) and
noodles with spicy mushroom ragu. Sweet treats during CNY usually
consist of candied things (like coconut, winter melon, lotus seeds,
kumquats, or ginger), a steamed glutinous rice cake called [nin
gou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nian_gao), pomelo and clementines,
and [peanut puff (角仔)](/2011/02/peanut-puff-step-by-step.html).
But it's cold out, and I wanted to make something warm and comforting.

The [recipe](http://en.christinesrecipes.com/2015/01/chinese-almond-dessert.html)
I followed makes 2 to 3 servings, so I tripled it. 
I began by soaking 450 grams of natural almonds in cold water for a few
hours.  This served two purposes: to allow the skins to be slipped
off, and to soften the nuts for the blender. If you buy unblanched
almonds, you'll save yourself some time and effort. I also washed and soaked
some jasmine rice, which serves to thicken the soup.

The next step is to liquify the almonds and rice with water. Using a
powerful blender like a VitaMix or BlendTec, this won't take much
time. You also won't need to strain everything through a cheesecloth,
unless you want an ultra-smooth texture. As this mixture is cooked,
it will start to thicken and set on the bottom of the pot. Keep
stirring with a whisk or silicone spoon, so that the cooked rice
doesn't burn or form lumps.  Chinese sweet soups are typically
sweetened with rock sugar (冰糖), a mild, crystalline sugar, and
you add it towards the end. I ended up doubling the sugar called
for in the recipe, to suit my taste.

Some recipes call for 北杏 (literally, north almonds, aka bitter
almonds) to be added, to enhance the flavour. Found in Chinese
groceries or medicinal shops, these are actually the kernels of a
type of apricot. Health Canada
[warns](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/pubs/securit/2009-apricots-abricots/index-eng.php)
about their potential toxicity and advises against their use. I
added a few drops of almond extract instead.

I love _tong sui_. I grew up eating sweet soups of all kinds (nut-based,
adzuki, mung bean, bird's nest, papaya, silken tofu, _tangyuan_
glutinous rice dumpling), so I love them. But it's definitely an
acquired taste. This almond sweet soup turned out okay: a little bit
grainy, with a delicate almond flavour. In the future, I'd keep the 
proportions of almond and rice, but would try roasting the almonds first
and straining the soup to get a silkier mouthfeel.
