To make the reduced pear puree, I took a tin of canned pears, liquified it with a hand blender, then gently simmered the mixture over low heat until the weight was halved. The glucose was very sticky and thick and I'm glad it's measured by weight. It melted quite easily in the pot with the cream. The completed ganache mixture was very soft and was still a bit soft after an overnight crystallization. I chilled it in the fridge just so it would be easier to cut. Dipping was fine, and I got a good temper on the milk chocolate. The pear flavour is quite subtle, with the occasional bit of smushed pear reminding you of its presence.
