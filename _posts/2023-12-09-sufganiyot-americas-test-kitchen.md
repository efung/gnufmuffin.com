In previous [Hanukkah](/tag/hanukkah/) celebrations, I've made
a variety of different fried things, but rarely the traditional filled,
jelly doughnut. This year, for our epic party of 60+ guests, I stuck
with what people expect.

The [recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/16002-sufganiyot-hanukkah-jelly-doughnuts) is from America's Test Kitchen, publishers
of our beloved [Cook's Illustrated](/tag/cook-s-illustrated/) magazine.
Each batch is supposed to make a dozen 3" donuts, but I planned on using
a 2.5" cutter to get a few more, and to **quadruple** the recipe,
aiming for 60 doughnuts plus whatever the scraps would make.

To streamline making four batches of dough the night before, I started
mixing the next one while the previous one was resting for the prescribed
20 minutes. I tried to fit all four batches into two giant bowls, 
separated by parchment, then juggled them around to continue kneading.

The next morning, at around 08:30, I took the doughs out of the fridge,
to let them get up to room temperature and finishing proofing. 
Unfortunately, the dough stuck to the not-well-greased parchment.
But it was very easy to roll it too thin, so be careful. We took all 
the leftover scraps and made dozens of little doughnut holes as well.

By 11:00, I was starting to fry in my big, orange Dutch oven filled with
grapeseed oil. The remote probe thermometer I have from Polder is
faulty: not only does it not maintain the _set_ temperature, it
beeps annoyingly at seemingly random times. Still, I was able to
make batch after batch of evenly golden donuts. 

As the batches cooled down, Dr. S and my daughter started to fill them.
The night before, I made a double batch of [6 Minute Lemon Custard](/2017/12/6-minute-lemon-olive-oil-custard.html) 
and also bought jars of raspberry jam. Pro-tip: make sure the fillings 
are cold so that they are not so runny when piping. I tossed the fried
holes in a mix of granulated sugar and cinnamon.

These were a huge hit. **Every single one of these doughnuts got
eaten at the party.** Since the dough is essentially brioche based,
they were very tender and flavourful. I'm a little sad that I
wasn't able to sample a filled one, and only got to have a few of
the holes. Highly recommended recipe!
