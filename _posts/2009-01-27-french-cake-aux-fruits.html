excerpt: "Corriher points out that this isn\'t like a traditional Christmas fruitcake, in that it is a cake with some fruit in it, rather than a lot of fruit with some cake in it. I used the suggested Grand Marnier-soaked raisins, as well as adding dried cranberries, candied orange peel and Luxardo Marasca cherries."

I used the suggested Grand Marnier-soaked raisins, as well as adding dried cranberries, candied orange peel and Luxardo Marasca cherries. Toasting the pecans is a must to fully bring out their flavor. This cake is one of the recipes in this book in which she adds whipped cream to the batter, claiming it enriches the flavour and makes it wonderfully light. These claims are true, but I think every cake would be improved by the addition of whipped cream! A fine, rich fruit cake that would be a great teatime treat.
