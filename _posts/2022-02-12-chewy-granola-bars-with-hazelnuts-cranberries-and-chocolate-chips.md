In theory, granola bars are a great school snack. Portable,
flavourful, little mess, inexpensive. But, most store-bought
kinds are very low in protein, too high in sugar, often
contain nuts, and just don't taste good. Plus, kids
are finicky eaters, and their tastes change on a weekly,
sometimes, hourly basis.

So, it was to my great surprise that my daughter was 
interested in a homemade granola bar. She's taken to
eating a lot of dried apricots, and I told her that
this [recipe](https://www.hezzi-dsbooksandcooks.com/chewy-granola-bars-pecans-cranberries/) purees them to bind the granola together.

The directions begin with toasting rolled oats, ground nuts,
and sunflower seeds. While that was slowly browning, I soaked
some old dried cranberries (we didn't have cherries) in an herbal,
cranberry tea to plump them. Since I didn't have quite enough, I
made up the difference with additional dried apricots.

In the same food processor used to grind the nuts, I made the
fruit puree (apricots, sugar, oil, water). This gets stirred 
with the toasted ingredients, along with the other mix-ins:
Rice Krispies cereal, and chocolate chips. I gave my daughter
a sample of cocoa nibs (which the original recipe calls for) 
which she emphatically rejected.

These bars were a big hit, not only with my daughter but Dr. S
as well. The texture is quite soft and crumbly, and they've
stayed that way for a whole week, tightly sealed. The nutty
fragrance (gotta love hazelnuts) and the sweet-tangy flavour
is something that is missing in commercial granola bars.

Of course, since this recipe included hazelnuts, it wasn't
a candidate for bringing to school. But, I'm often met with cries 
of hunger around 17:00, so I'll be handing these out when I
pick my kids up after school.
