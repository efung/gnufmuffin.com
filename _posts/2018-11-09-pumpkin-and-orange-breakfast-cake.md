There's a lot more orange-fleshed squash than pumpkin out there.
[This page](https://www.chowhound.com/food-news/155277/get-to-know-these-11-winter-squashes-for-a-tasty-fall/)
lists a bunch of them. With hunks of leftover butternut and Kabocha squash 
in the fridge, I made this breakfast cake to rave reviews.

The [recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/pumpkin-and-orange-breakfast-cake-with-a-fresh-orange-syrup-recipe-1956063) 
comes from my favourite baking book, [In The Sweet Kitchen](/tag/in-the-sweet-kitchen/). Instead
of buying boring pumpkin purée, it's easy to roast a halved, seeded squash 
the next time you have a hot oven running. In about a half an hour, you'll be able
to scoop out the soft insides, and mash them into a nice, homemade purée.

_Do not skimp on the orange zest_, if you love citrus flavours. Do measure it, as two 
full tablespoons is a lot more than you think. This cake is pretty standard, in terms of
creaming the butter and sugar, folding in the puree and dry ingredients, and finally, 
whipped egg whites. I baked for the full 60 minutes.

This cake was delicious the morning after I made it, and still delicious on the 2nd, 
3rd, and subsequent mornings! It has a strong orange taste, without a strong squash 
flavour. Its texture is surprisingly light for a cake made with squash. I think the
combination of a generous amount of baking powder plus whipped whites helps achieve
this delicate balance.

I don't usually make a syrup, but decided that a fresh orange one would be delicious,
and was not wrong. The cake doesn't need it, but use it sparingly as it tends to make
the cake soggy (I served it in a squeeze bottle). Another winner from Regan Daley, but
I've come to expect that with every recipe from this book.
