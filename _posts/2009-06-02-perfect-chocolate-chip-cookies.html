excerpt: "Well, perfect, according to Cook\'s Illustrated. This article evaluated the techniques described in the New York Times\' recipe from last summer, as well as the original Toll House recipe. I tried the NYT one last fall and wasn\'t blown away. But I must say that this recipe was worth getting up at 07:00"

This article evaluated the techniques described in the New York Times' recipe from last summer, as well as the original Toll House recipe. I tried the NYT one <a href="/2008/11/chocolate-chip-cookies.html">last fall</a> and wasn't blown away. But I must say that this recipe was worth getting up at 07:00 for. I did a double batch, and followed their advice to bake only one tray at a time; I made about 40 cookies in five batches. Every step and ingredient is designed to add flavour or achieve their desired texture. These cookies exuded an intoxicating butterscotch aroma and featured a crisp exterior and chewy interior as promised. I found that the batch I made with pecans spread less, plus, nuts make all cookies better anyway. Will add this to my repertoire for sure.
