excerpt: "As a fitting end for our Hanukkah party, I knew this olive oil gelato would be a special and unusual treat. This recipe from Williams-Sonoma is adapted from one in The Babbo Cookbook but alters it so that the egg yolks are cooked. I was a bit worried as to how the olive oil would combine with the rest"

This recipe from Williams-Sonoma is adapted from one in The Babbo Cookbook but alters it so that the egg yolks are cooked. I was a bit worried as to how the olive oil would combine with the rest of the ingredients, but it seemed to form an emulsion quite readily. Because of the whipped eggs, the final mixture is quite foamy. This gelato melted quite quickly, not sure if that's due to the metal container I packed it in, or insufficient ripening time in the freezer, but I had to serve it quickly. Atop mini ice cream cones, a small scoop of gelato was just the amount for small kids and for adults who were uncertain about this flavour. The nuttiness of the <abbr title="extra-virgin olive oil">EVOO</abbr> olive oil (the Kirkland house brand from Costco) was quite apparent to me, but many tasters commented on its subtlety. A fun experiment! I'll have to try the raw egg-yolk Batali recipe sometime for comparison as well.
