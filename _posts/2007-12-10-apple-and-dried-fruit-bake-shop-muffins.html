excerpt: "I made another batch of 18 muffins with the remainder of the sour cream plus some yogurt. I added two chopped Paula Red apples to the batter, and also a handful of dried cranberries and raisins (in separate batches to suit Dr. S) soaked in apple liqueur. A final topping of cinnamon sugar and ground nuts"

I added two chopped Paula Red apples to the batter, and also a handful of dried cranberries and raisins (in separate batches to suit Dr. S) soaked in apple liqueur. A final topping of cinnamon sugar and ground nuts (from the rugelach) completed these muffins. They were quite spongy but tasty; however, I totally underestimated the amount of fruit I should have used.
