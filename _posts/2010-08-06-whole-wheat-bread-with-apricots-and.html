I used fresh buttermilk combined with regular milk, in place of dried powder mixed with water. In place of some of the whole wheat flour, I threw in a bit of buckwheat flour, a little kamut flour and probably another whole grain flour too. Another substitution was using dried pears for some of the dried apricots. <br /><br />The loaves that I baked were enormous and dense. The texture is a little crumbly, but was expected given some of the gluten-free substitutions I made, and the fact that it's a 100% whole wheat bread. It was quite a hit with everyone who had a piece. My suggestion would be to slice thinly, and/or serve toasted.
