We were in charge of dessert again for a monthly Friday night
potluck.  I've been making a lot of
[apple](http://www.gnufmuffin.com/tag/apple/) things recently, so
I thought it would be good to change things up. What better than a
warm tart, made of chocolate and banana? Why, two tarts, of course!

Since the full Sweet Tart Dough recipe makes enough for four
8&nbsp;3/4" tins, it was not a lot of extra work to double this
[tart
recipe](http://www.zencancook.com/2010/03/warm-chocolate-banana-tart/) from
Pierre Hermé and Dorie Greenspan's cookbook.  Blind baking two tart
shells is also a snap.

I only made one batch of the booze-soaked raisins, as my wife is
inexplicably not a fan. Instead of dark rum, I substituted a chestnut
liqueur.

The directions for caramelizing the banana slices sounded very
tasty: infusing the fat with a piece of Habanero pepper, frying the
fruit until the exterior browns, then garnishing with black pepper.
For the first batch, I used what I had, namely Jalapeño pepper, but 
a few seconds after the slices went in the pan, I encountered problems.
The 1/8" slices of banana got soft very quickly over high heat,
and didn't get a chance to caramelize. In fact, they only coloured
because of the browned bits of butter.

For the second batch, I tried slicing the bananas thicker (about
&frac12;") and increasing the heat. These were better, but still started
to fall apart. There wasn't anything wrong with the taste of these
bananas, but for nice looking slices, I imagine blowtorching is the way
to go.

The ganache needs to be carefully made and the directions call for
mixing the chocolate and butter at a specific temperature. If you're not
careful, the mixture won't emulsify, and you'll end up with drops of
butterfat that will leave a slick on the surface.

This is a standout tart. Served slightly warm, each bite is rich
and chocolatey, punctuated by chunks of sweet, cooked banana. I
couldn't taste any heat from the chili, so I would increase the
amount of black pepper next time.
