You, dear reader, may know that I love to seek out new tastes, and
boldly try the unfamiliar. So when I saw J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt describing
how ice cream and [chile crisp](https://thewoksoflife.com/lao-gan-ma-noodles/) 
taste good together, my heart beat a little faster.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021203-sichuan-chile-crisp-sundae-with-peanut-streusel) was
published in the New York Times. The peanut streusel starts with what you might put on a coffee cake, but
adds a mouth-watering mix of Sichuan peppercorns, chili flakes, star anise, 
cumin, fennel, and peanuts. Earlier this spring, I made a big batch of chili crisp from 
this [recipe](https://spicetrekkers.com/recipes/easy-chili-crisp), and I bought a tub of
Kawartha Dairy vanilla ice cream from Costco, so I was all set.

A spoonful of chili oil over ice cream is definitely out there, but
I enjoyed the unexpected combination of "hot" and cold, sweet and salty. What really
makes this sundae special, is the crumble. It has so many flavours going on, that
every spoonful is different, and very addictive. I kept adding more spoonfuls of
streusel as I ate. Go and make this right now!
