This is my contribution to this month's <a href="http://www.lovescool.com/archives/2005/10/23/shf13wrapup/">Sugar High Friday</a>, hosted by Kelli from lovescool, and the theme is <b>dark chocolate</b>.<br /><br />Finding a recipe that uses dark chocolate is never too difficult, but I looked through my cookbooks and nothing really appealed to me. I had a sizeable chunk left from a <a title="2.5 kg!!!">big</a> slab of Callebaut bittersweet chocolate and some <a href="http://www.lasiembra.com/cocoa.htm">Cocoa Camino</a> organic cocoa: what to make? Turning to the Internet, I stumbled upon Nick Malgieri's <a href="http://nickmalgieri.com/recipes/choc_mascarpone.html">recipe</a> for this tart. Perfect, since I had some leftover mascarpone and all the other ingredients.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/54559172/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/26/54559172_ff0cb2e520_m.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="240" height="180" alt="Chocolate Mascarpone Tart" /></a>The crust is very simple as the food processor does all the work. After adding the egg to the dry ingredients, the mixture still looked sandy. As I gathered it into a ball, it came together, but a little on the crumbly side. I made the syrup, then melted the butter and chocolate pieces in it. As I whisked the mascarpone and eggs together, there were small lumps of cream cheese that I couldn't quite eliminate. When I stirred in the chocolate mixture, they looked like they disappeared but I worried that there would be white bits speckled throughout the tart! The chilled dough was difficult to roll out as it didn't quite stick together. Since the amount fit a 10" pan perfectly without much scraps, I had to make sure not to roll it too thin. As the crust and filling baked, both puffed up a bit.<br /><br />After letting it cool overnight, I melted some milk chocolate and streaked the top using a small Ziploc bag. Some Kahlua-flavoured lightly sweetened whipped cream completed the dessert. The tart resembles a cheesecake without the tanginess and smoothness. The crust is a bit crumbly and dry. All in all, it was pronounced quite delicious by my tasters. That's just another example of how anything made with dark chocolate is usually a success!
