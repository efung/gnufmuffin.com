A local "fitness café" called [Sweat and Soda](https://sweatandsoda.com/) introduced
me to sesame lattés, a non-caffeinated beverage made by steaming milk 
with a bit of sugar and two tablespoons of tahini. The drink has a subtle
nutty and slightly bitter taste that I like very much. Those same
flavors found their way into these cookies that I made for an evening
meeting at our house.

I found this [recipe](http://www.eatingfromthegroundup.com/2012/12/tahini-cookies/)
from the cookbook [_Jerusalem_](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/cook-the-book-jerusalem-a-cookbook.html).
The base is a simple sugar cookie, with the addition of tahini. It makes
a really soft dough, easy to work with. To ensure consistency
and even baking, I weighed each portion, then let my daughter roll them
into spheres. I dusted one batch with cinnamon, and made one batch plain.

Hours out of the oven, these cookies were delicate and crumbly,
with crisp edges, and a very mild, but detectable, sesame flavour.
I found the cinnamon distracting, and preferred the undusted batch.
If I ever need to make a cookie assortment, this recipe would
definitely make the cut.
