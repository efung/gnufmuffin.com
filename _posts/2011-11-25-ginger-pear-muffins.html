excerpt: "A bunch of ripe, Bosc pears suggested another baking project, and I settled on this recipe in Mollie Katzen's breakfast recipes book. As with most muffin recipes, these were really easy to put together. I may have overmixed these a bit, or used too much pear, as they came out a little gluey.  Maybe"

As with most muffin recipes, these were really easy to put together. I may have overmixed these a bit, or used too much pear, as they came out a little gluey.  Maybe next time I'd use cake flour. But the pear and ginger flavours go really well together and were enjoyed by my tasters.
