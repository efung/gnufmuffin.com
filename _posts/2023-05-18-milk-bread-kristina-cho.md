Sometimes, our breakfasts are more involved, like blueberry scones made from scratch. Other times,
it's pouring milk into a bowl of cereal. One of our most frequent morning meals is toast:
spread with nut butter or marmalade, or covered with mashed avocado and an eye-popping amount
of black pepper. When we run out of bread, I am a little (okay, more than a little) miffed if
we have to buy a loaf of supermarket bread. 

Milk bread makes beautifully soft and sweet sandwich bread, and I've made a similar bread 
called [shokupan](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2022/04/shokupan-cooks-illustrated.html). But this time
I tried the version of milk bread from Kristina Cho's book,
[Mooncakes & Milk Bread](https://eatchofood.com/cookbook).

The [recipe](https://cherrybombe.com/recipes/kristina-cho-milk-bread) starts with a tangzhong, the
partially cooked flour and water paste that is responsible for the pillowy texture. I made this in
the microwave rather than the stovetop. After scalding the milk, everything went into the stand mixer.
This version has 4 tbsp of butter and an egg, making it quite rich.

What a loaf! It's super light and fluffy, sweet and satisfying.
Slices of this bread toasted up really darkly, so keep an eye on
it. I wouldn't make this for everyday breakfast, but it's definitely
a treat. Pro-tip: slice this thicker so it holds up better when you're
applying your favourite spread.
