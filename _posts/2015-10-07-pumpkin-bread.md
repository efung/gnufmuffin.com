Fall is here, and that means pumpkins are also. A neighbour gave us a
big container of cooked pumpkin, so in addition to soup, we made a
loaf of pumpkin bread with walnuts.

The [recipe](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/pumpkin_bread/) comes
from Simply Recipes, and is a pretty standard quick bread enhanced with
lots of spices and flavour-boosting additions. Per my family's
preferences, I only used the full amount of ground ginger, reducing the
rest of the "pumpkin pie" spices to a mere pinch. Although the
orange glaze was enticing, I skipped it to avoid the extra sugar.

This was an easy loaf, that used about a cup of puree. It's moist and
tender, without an overpowering flavour, exactly what I want in a
pumpkin quick bread.
