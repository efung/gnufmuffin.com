In honour of Canada Day, I made a batch of maple walnut ice cream, a
cool treat to enjoy on a warm day.

The
[recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/05/maple-walnut-ice-cream-recipe.html)
is from Serious Eats, and has two simple steps. First, finely chopped
walnuts are steeped in hot milk and cream. Then, the strained liquid is
used to make the custard base.

I deviated very slightly from the given recipe, using four egg yolks rather
than six (I hate having to find uses for leftover [egg
whites](/tag/eggwhites/)), and using a medium dark maple syrup 
(Costco only sells one kind). This recipe calls for cooking the custard 
directly on the stove, but a recipe I've used in the
[past](/2007/07/frozen-desserts-for-potluck.html) instructs you to
bake the custard in a water bath. Whichever method you use, the idea is
to cook the eggs gently until the mixture thickens.

Despite the walnut-infused cream, I found the maple flavour to be the
dominant one. It's plenty sweet, but could be nuttier (maybe by
adding walnut oil?).
