This line got my attention: "sweet but not sugary, packed with whole
grains but not dense, and reasonably rich in fiber, protein, complex
carbohydrates and healthy fats". It's from a recent
[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/dining/healthy-muffins-recipe-video.html?_r=0)
in the NY Times about a healthy muffin recipe. I gave it a try and
was pleased with the results.

The
[recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017990-whole-grain-blueberry-muffins-with-orange-streusel)
is a template for whole grain muffins: you can use either WW flour or
wheat germ; you can use dried fruit instead of fresh; you can use
different types of vegetable oil; and you can make it with or without
nuts. Most muffin recipes are pretty forgiving, but I'm assuming
this recipe is particularly so.

For a first attempt, I stuck with the recipe as written, using the
following choices: toasted wheat germ, coconut oil, a mix of grated
apples and carrots, halved spice quantities, frozen blueberries, and 
no nuts. I've never used coconut oil for baking or anything else
before, but had a jar in the pantry (from who knows what cooking
project). It is solid at room temperature, but placing the unopened
jar in a bowl of hot tap water quickly melted it.

The batter was quite loose and wet, even after resting for 30 minutes. I
didn't stir in the frozen blueberries until this point, so they wouldn't
bleed. I scooped the mixture into 6 jumbo muffin cups, plus 12 large-sized 
ones. The muffins needed the full 20 minutes in the oven, and they still
looked a bit moist. I sprayed the cups generously with PAM, but
didn't really need to. These muffins were quite greasy and soaked
through their paper liners.

As for how these muffins tasted, I would consider them very good:
a soft but coarse and moist crumb, without any roughness that often
betrays a healthy muffin. Even without the orange streusel, I thought
these muffins had a lot of flavour. I would definitely make these
again.
