At a recent dinner party, Dr. S wanted to feature rhubarb (yup,
we're subscribed to the Thames River Melon [market box](https://www.thamesrivermelons.com/market-box-details) again). 
It's usually a sweet ingredient, but we made a wonderful
chicken tagine with vanilla-scented poached rhubarb. For dessert,
we used it in an upside down cake.

The [version from last year](/2021/05/rhubarb-upside-down-cake.html) was a real winner, but I wanted to try something different.
This [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013611-rhubarb-upside-down-cake) is from Melissa Clark, and was just so-so.

The directions are very similar to many other classic upside-down cake
recipes. Pour a butter-sugar mixture into the bottom of a pan, add
the fruit, add a yellow cake batter. Bake, invert. I like how she
asks you to massage the lemon zest into the sugar, to really extract
all the oils.

Our guests enjoyed this cake, but it was definitely ordinary. I'd stick
with Cook's Illustrated's 2021 recipe, as it had the streusel base,
as well as the gorgeous jammy top.
