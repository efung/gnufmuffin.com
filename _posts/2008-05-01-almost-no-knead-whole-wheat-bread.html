They tweak it by adding vinegar and lager to the dough, and doing 15 seconds of kneading before shaping. In the morning, I made the dough following the whole wheat variation. It felt like a regular dough, not one with a lot of liquid (this recipe is about 70% hydration). After about 10 hours <span style="font-style:italic;">autolyse</span>, I gave it a brief knead then let it rest. Slashing with a razor opened up the bread immediately, and it sprung quite nicely in the oven. The crust is gorgeous, soft and not crisp, except for the bottom. Perhaps I should have preheated the pot a little longer than 10 minutes. The interior was slightly doughy and dense, but all my tasters declared it delicious. Will be making the other variations soon.
