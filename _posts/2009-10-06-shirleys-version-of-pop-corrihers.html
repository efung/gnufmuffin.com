It turned out to be substantial (filling a whole 10" tube pan), moist, and deeply satisfying. I didn't find the large quantity (6 tsp) of spices to be overpowering, even though I used freshly ground allspice. The second time I made this, the one pictured here, I used homemade applesauce and dried cranberries. It turned out a little too moist, but then again, I did use a few extra tablespoons of applesauce. Highly recommended.
