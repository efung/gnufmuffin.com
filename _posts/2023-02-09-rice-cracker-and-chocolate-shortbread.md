In keeping with the Asian theme of the cookies I was bringing
to the office, the final day saw another unusual combination: 
toasted, savoury rice crackers as a mix-in to shortbread.

The [recipe](https://eatchofood.com/blog/2022/12/12/rice-cracker-and-chocolate-shortbread) is by Kristina Cho, author of the recently
published [_Mooncakes & Milk Bread_](https://eatchofood.com/cookbook)
cookbook. She doesn't specify what brand of rice cracker to use.
Fortunately, my brother's girlfriend gifted us with a huge assortment
a few weeks before. I weighed out the right amount and broke them up by
hand into big chunks, before kneading it into the cookie dough.

This one didn't turn out as I expected. Although the soy-chocolate
flavour was interesting, the large chunks of rice cracker turned
hard and dense, and were unpleasant to chew on. I had to rush slicing
the warm, baked square into bars, and they were very brittle.

All in all, an interesting experiment, and I might try it again but
breaking the rice crackers into smaller bits so they disperse
better in the dough.
