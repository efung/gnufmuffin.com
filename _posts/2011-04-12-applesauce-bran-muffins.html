excerpt: "The last container of applesauce in our freezer served as the inspiration for these muffins. I wanted a bran muffin I hadn\'t made before and these looked good. To compensate for accidentally measuring 1 cup of yogurt+milk instead of two-thirds cup buttermilk, I added about a quarter cup of wheat germ"

I wanted a bran muffin I hadn't made before and these looked good. To compensate for accidentally measuring 1 cup of yogurt+milk instead of two-thirds cup buttermilk, I added about a quarter cup of wheat germ and a bit more wheat bran. A few other substitutions were using white sugar plus additional molasses instead of brown sugar, and toasted walnuts instead of raisins. This recipe turned out a dozen large muffins, very moist, with a nice balance of flavors. Highly recommended.
