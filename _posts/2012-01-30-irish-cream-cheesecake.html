I wasn't planning on a dessert but a friend of ours who was spending a few days at our place was also celebrating her birthday. What's more festive than a cheesecake made with Baileys? I knew I wanted a recipe that had a significant quantity of liqueur, no wimpy-flavoured ones with only a few tablespoons of alcohol. The recipe I found also featured a graham crust embellished with oats, and a caramelized almond garnish, which sounded amazing.<br /><br />What a great cheesecake! Everyone loved the strong Irish cream flavour. Although there are three components, each step can be done separately ahead of time. Highly recommended.
