excerpt: "With the leftover pear nectar and pear halves from the charlotte, I made up a batch of these easy muffins. My only changes were to omit the lemon zest and substitute unsweetened muesli for the granola. Not a lot of fat in these, just a few tablespoons of oil and egg yolks. These weren\'t very appetizing:"

My only changes were to omit the lemon zest and substitute unsweetened muesli for the granola. Not a lot of fat in these, just a few tablespoons of oil and egg yolks. These weren't very appetizing: gummy texture and some of the muesli flakes were chewy. Maybe they'll be better toasted.
