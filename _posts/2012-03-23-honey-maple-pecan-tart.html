excerpt: "I don't remember why I wanted to make a nut tart, but I recall wanting a dessert made with maple syrup for Friday dinner with friends. I also got to use an oblong tin that I don't often work with. The filling is very, very runny, and it's not set with eggs so make sure any cracks in the crust are"

I also got to use an oblong tin that I don't often work with. The filling is very, very runny, and it's not set with eggs so make sure any cracks in the crust are patched. Chilling it will help firm it up as well. This is a very sweet dessert, so serve this cut into thin pieces.
