excerpt: "This tried-and-true recipe is a favourite of mine because of the intense, pure citrus flavour in the finished product. But I\'ve never liked the whipping cream that goes into it so I decided to try a lower fat variation. I made two batches this weekend: one using Liberté goat\'s milk yogurt and another"

But I've never liked the whipping cream that goes into it so I decided to try a lower fat variation. I made two batches this weekend: one using <a href="http://www.liberte.qc.ca/en/page.ch2?uid=Ournewproducts">Liberté goat's milk yogurt</a> and another quart using the lemon yogurt from the same company. Both turned out great and my tasters commented on the strong lime-y flavour. However, the goat variation got mixed reviews, as the gamey taste wasn't to everyone's liking.
