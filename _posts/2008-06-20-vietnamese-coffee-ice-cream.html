excerpt: "I bought the Trung Nguyen coffee a while ago at T&amp;T and having been drinking cups of it occasionally. I\'m not sure what the strong flavour, maybe camphor? Or the Chari or Catimor beans? Anyway, an entire half cup went into the ice cream base, tinting it a deep brown. Passing it through my mesh strainer"

I'm not sure what the strong flavour, maybe camphor? Or the Chari or Catimor beans? Anyway, an entire half cup went into the ice cream base, tinting it a deep brown. Passing it through my mesh strainer didn't get all the bits out, so after a night in the fridge, I strained it through a double layer of cheesecloth, but a few fine grains of coffee still made it into the ice cream. It's very, very strong: I would cut the ground coffee back to one-third cup or so next time.
