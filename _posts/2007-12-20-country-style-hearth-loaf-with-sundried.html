excerpt: "For a work potluck, I wanted to use up a large batch of olives (which I bought to make the fruitcake) by making tapenade, so I thought of making a loaf of bread to go along with it. The original recipe calls for thyme which the supermarket was out of (!); oregano seemed like a good substitute that would"

The original recipe calls for thyme which the supermarket was out of (!); oregano seemed like a good substitute that would work well with the tomatoes. To approximate the 20% bran wheat flour, the authors suggest mixing white flour and whole wheat flour in a 3:1 ratio. I used white bread flour, stoneground whole wheat flour, durum whole wheat flour and kamut flour. In the morning, I made the poolish and let it ferment. In the evening, I mixed the dough and let it rise for the recommended minimum times. My kitchen became warmer during the evening, so I think I let the loaves rest for too long during the final rise as they didn't spring too much in the oven. This is a very tasty bread with prominent herb and tomato flavours. It does take a while to make as the authors recommend letting the dough rise slowly at 78Â°F which is quite cool.
