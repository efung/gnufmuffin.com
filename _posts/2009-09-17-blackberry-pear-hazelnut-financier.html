excerpt: "With all of the egg whites left over from making two batches of creme anglaise, I searched online for financier recipes and found this one. There\'s nothing difficult in this recipe, but you do have to toast, skin and grind hazelnuts, as well as accumulate the egg whites. Instead of cranberries, I used"

There's nothing difficult in this recipe, but you do have to toast, skin and grind hazelnuts, as well as accumulate the egg whites. Instead of cranberries, I used the last of our frozen blackberries (from two summers ago I think!). I found the finished cake to be a little on the salty side, and the moistness and flavour were not that appealing.
