excerpt: "A bulging bag of hazelnuts was the inspiration to look for hazelnut recipes, and I knew this was a recipe I wanted to try as I also had a forlorn package of cocoa nibs and an abundance of jams. I decided to use the jar of raspberry jam from Harvest Song that someone gave us at our housewarming, as linzertorte"

I decided to use the jar of raspberry jam from <a href="http://www.harvestsongventures.com/">Harvest Song</a> that someone gave us at our housewarming, as linzertorte (which this cookie is reminiscent of) often uses this flavour combination. I began by grinding the cocoa nibs in a clean coffee grinder, while the hazelnuts toasted in a toaster oven. After skinning them, I turned them into powder in a food processor. The dough is quite soft and pliable but it does stick together if you knead it a bit by hand. Rolling it out between two sheets of wax paper was pretty simple and the butter and hazelnut oil helped to keep it from sticking. I was able to fit almost 50 squares from this dough on a full sheet pan. The next morning, I sandwiched them with a teaspoon of jam, then dipped them in chocolate. These were fantastic: the cookie is soft and crumbly with nice hazelnut flavour, and the contrast between no-sugar jam and bittersweet chocolate is perfect.
