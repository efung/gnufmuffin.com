Ever since this article, I've seen mention of Mrs. London in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/dining/05babk.html?ref=dining">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://pastryna.com/pastryna_about.htm">Pastry &amp; Baking North America</a>. The babka recipe is very labour-intensive but this past weekend, I made it not once, but twice! There were only two uncommon ingredients: almond paste, a 66/34 (almond/sugar ratio) version which I found at McCall's, and, sponge cake, leftover from <a href="/2007/10/pies-4-quiche-and-boston-cream.html">pie class</a> last year (!!!).<br /><br />On Friday/Saturday, I made loaves using dried cherries instead of raisins; the 2nd time, I used raisins but tweaked it in a few ways. I used a bit less water in the almond-crumb mixture, as it seemed too wet. I used much less cinnamon sugar as I found it to be too much. I didn't bother to press the mixture into the dough as all that chocolate makes this a messy job.  The shaping could use a better description: after rolling into a log, form the dough into a U-shape, then twist. <br /><br />Wow, is this ever a tasty bread, especially the one still warm from the oven on Saturday afternoon. The bread itself has a delicious, buttery-citrus flavour, then you taste the almond paste and chocolate, and then you bite into a tangy piece of dried fruit. Streusel on the top and sides adds crunch and contrast. Lots of work, but well worth it.
