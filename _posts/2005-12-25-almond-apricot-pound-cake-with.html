I incorporated them along with the chopped apricots. I was able to find <a href="http://www.odense.com/faq.cfm">Odense marzipan</a> at Whole Foods in Oakville. I used peach schnapps: unfortunately, it tastes a bit too artificial and sweet. This is a very flavourful cake, but that's to be expected when the ingredient list includes almond extract, marzipan, ground almonds, amaretto, apricot liqueur and dried apricots!
