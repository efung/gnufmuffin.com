We've established a tradition of cupcakes for birthdays in our family.
My son's fourth birthday celebration was to be a pizza lunch in the park 
on the weekend, but we wanted an _additional_ cake to celebrate on his
actual birthdate. My wife suggested an ice cream cake, and as usual, I
picked something a little complicated.

Martha Stewart's
[recipe](http://www.marthastewart.com/340206/banana-split-bombe) for
this ice cream [bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe_glac%C3%A9e) calls
for three ice creams, a cake, a ganache and a topping. To save myself
some work, I used store-bought vanilla and chocolate ice creams.
I softened the entire 1.89L tub of vanilla ice cream, and used a
large spoon to line the inside of a mixing bowl that I chilled in the
freezer.

The next step was to make a banana ganache. I was able to accelerate the
chilling of the chocolate mixture by putting it in the freezer, and
stirring it every ten minutes or so. The ganache got firm quickly when
spread on the ice cream layer, so I had to work quickly to apply it
evenly.

Someone suggested that I replace the pistachio ice cream in the recipe
for peanut butter ice cream. That seemed like a brilliant idea to me, so
I made a batch using a recipe from _A Passion for Ice Cream_ by [Emily
Luchetti](http://www.emilyluchetti.com/index.php). It calls for infusing
cream with roasted peanuts, as well as blending in peanut butter into
the ice cream base. This layer is not spread all over the inside of the bowl
but forms a flat layer in the bottom.

The chocolate ice cream is also spread flat on the bottom of the bowl,
over the peanut butter ice cream layer.

The banana cake is like a banana quick bread, baked in a 9" round tin.
It incorporates both mashed and diced banana, and bakes up soft and delicate,
thanks to the use of cake flour. I needed to trim it to fit inside the
bowl.

I cut the cake layer slightly too small, so I plugged the gaps using
an icing syringe (yes, I own such a gadget) filled with softened
chocolate ice cream. So that the bombe would sit flat on a serving
platter, I trimmed away excess ice cream and ganache at the top of the
bowl.

Here's the finished bombe. To unmold it, I inverted the bombe onto a
cake plate, then blasted the bowl's exterior with a puny butane torch.
It took almost 10 minutes before it fell out. To make the topping,
I used 2T of cocoa butter melted in with the bittersweet chocolate
as I didn't have vegetable shortening. The topping sets quickly,
so have your chopped peanuts (I used Ontario-grown Valencia) on
hand to sprinkle on top.

After a few days in the freezer, the bombe was very, very solid. I
didn't take it out early enough before serving, and it was rock hard.
Even though we used a sharp chef's knife dipped into hot water, we
still needed a lot of elbow grease to cut slices for everyone. The
chocolate topping layer was way too thick, as was the ganache layer.
Next time, I would make both of these thinner, and allow for more
time for the bombe to thaw. The problem is that the outside layer
will get too soft, by the time the interior is soft. Increasing overrun
(churning more air into the ice cream) might help also.

This dessert is very rich, and it easily can serve more than 16
people. By varying the ice creams and cake layers, it's a basic
template for an ice cream cake that looks great at the table.
