The yeasted batter (with raw egg and milk) needs to rest for 6 to 8 hours, so I put it near an open window where it wasn't too warm. The batter wasn't quite cooked after the prescribed 5 minutes so my heat may have been a bit too low; but I'm not sure how a thick batter is supposed to cook in that amount of time. Broiling the cinnamon sugar in the oven took about 2 minutes. This pancake was a bit disappointing: more effort than the <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2007/03/german-apple-pancake.html">German apple pancake</a> but didn't yield a tastier result. Sure, a yeasted pancake is novel but this is a fussy recipe for a morning meal.
