I happened to see an ad for a Purim-themed online baking
event. The photo showed a fuchsia-hued cookie
in the distinctive triangular shape common to hamantaschen.
But there was nothing conventional about the striking
color of the cookie.

[Marianna Breytman](https://www.instagram.com/maribreyt/?hl=en) was
the host of the event, and it was put on by [Jewish&](https://www.instagram.com/jewish.and/), a program of the Miles Nadal JCC. The [recipe](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE5pmV78y0/YMGslzgvpsAUOh5Am9M5PA/view?utm_content=DAE5pmV78y0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) 
is distinctive because it calls for
[ube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea_alata) extract. I was
able to find it at an Asian grocery, but the one I got looked quite
artificial, with synthetic colour and flavour.

The dough itself was very soft and sticky, and turned out to be
very sweet. The colour was beautiful though, even after baking.
We filled our hamantaschen with the fillings we had made for
_another_ Purim project from a day before: caramel apple,
passionfruit and apricot, and chocolate raspberry.

While the look of these hamantaschen were stunning, using a filling
like [ube halaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea_alata) would 
help them to truly live up to their name.
