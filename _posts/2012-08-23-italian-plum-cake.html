Since we got back, I've been doing "repeat" baking, whipping up old favourites like <a href="/2009/06/perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html">chocolate-chip cookies</a> and <a href="/2007/09/maple-pecan-oatmeal-scones.html">oatmeal scones</a>. I tried a few new recipes too: chocolate-zucchini cake and peach-blueberry crisp but neglected to write about them.<br /><br />At the Withrow Park Farmer's market, I picked up a small basket of Italian prune plums, and augmented that with some "dinosaur eggs" a.k.a. pluots from the supermarket. I found this tart recipe and made it for company this week. It's made from ground almonds, so the texture is a crumbly, but eggy at the same time, somewhat like a clafouti. I made it one day before serving, holding the tart in the fridge. It tasted wonderful, but got denser and less appetizing after a few days.
