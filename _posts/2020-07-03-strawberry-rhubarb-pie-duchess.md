We made yet another delicious summer dessert this week, from the bountiful
rhubarb and strawberries we're getting in our market boxes from [this farm](https://www.thamesrivermelons.com/).
What caught my eye in this recipe, were the flavourings: cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, rosewater.
Also, it calls for an easy mixer butter-shortening pie crust, something I haven't made
in a while.

For years, my go-to recipes for pie dough, have been the [Cook's Illustrated vodka pie dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2007/11/cooks-illustrated-foolproof-pie-dough-recipe.html), or the version that Kenji Alt
describes that is an [all-butter pie dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/easy-pie-dough-recipe.html).
Anyhow, using shortening, like in this recipe from the _Duchess Bake Shop_ cookbook, makes for an extremely
flaky dough. I made the full recipe (three 9" crusts), and blind-baked one of them. I only did the first bake
(without pricking and then baking again).

Most, if not all, rhubarb recipes, require pre-cooking the filling. This one combines the fruit with the
sugar and dry spices, some cornstarch for thickening, and a bit of lemon juice, then calls for cooking the 
mixture until it is very thick. Adding the fresh sliced strawberries and rosewater loosens the filling.

The crumble topping isn't anything unexpected: oats, flour, sugar, butter, etc. There was just barely enough to
cover the bottom.

This pie wasn't too juicy, and did not spill over the edge by the time it was done (or maybe I just pulled it
as soon as it started to bubble). The edges of the crust browned very nicely without burning.

_Some of us_ couldn't wait for the pie to fully cool before digging in, so the slice above didn't hold together, but
tasted hot and delicious.

The photo above was taken the next day, after the pie had been kept at room temperature, so it looks
tidier. 

This is not a diner-style, mile-high pie that shows well in photographs. But it's a very good pie. The crust
was dry and crisp, even under the filling, but I wouldn't call it flaky. I absolutely loved the subtle flavours
in the filling, but they were too much for Dr. S who noticed all of the "odd" tastes immediately.
