The logs were quite sticky and crumbly, even after baking. Slicing them proved to be troublesome, as the pieces tended to break apart. Due to time constraints, I let them sit in the turned off oven for almost two days, hoping they would dry out. Instead, they stayed quite moist. While I found them to be a mediocre biscuit, many tasters gave them much higher praise. As the headnote to the recipe describes, the texture of these biscotti are definitely unusual, but I don't think I'd make them again.
