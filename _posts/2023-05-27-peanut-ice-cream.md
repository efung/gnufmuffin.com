At the library, I saw a familiar name on the cover of an interesting graphic novel slash
cookbook: Dirt Candy. It's a [15-year old restaurant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_Candy)
that serves inventive vegetarian food. The book was published 10 years ago, and reveals
the struggle and reality of operating a restaurant in a major urban city.

Inside the book, I found a really interesting ice cream recipe made from peanut milk,
made by soaking roasted peanuts in water, then pureeing that until it's smooth. This 
mixture is then combined with cream, egg yolks, and white chocolate.

While the peanut flavour was strong, and a little different than peanut _butter_, I
thought the texture of this ice cream wasn't smooth enough. That might be due to
the nut bits or the white chocolate. Still, I like the idea of a paler peanut
ice cream, just to surprise people.
