The first time, I made a double batch: a plain six-strand loaf, and the second, a simple braid with fresh pears. To make the latter, I diced a fresh pear and then blotted the cubes dry with paper towels. After flattening the three dough ropes, I sprinkled the pears down the centre, and then pinched the sides closed. This way, the pears wouldn't fall out during baking, or dry out and burn.<br /><br />The second time I used this <i>pareve</i> recipe, I decided to separate half the dough and add cocoa powder to it. This was a bit tricky as the quantities were small, and I eyeballed half of the egg mixture. The chocolate half ended up being too dry and I kept adding water while kneading. I rolled out three strands from each half-batch of dough, and followed the technique Glezer demonstrates in the video. There are also excellent braiding diagrams on the web page linked above.<br /><br />Of all of these variations, we enjoyed the pear one the best. It was moist and flavourful, with a surprising fruit centre. For me, a good challah needs to have enough eggs to give it richness and colour. Personally, I enjoy a loaf made with butter and milk even better. But for a dairy-free recipe, this one is pretty good and one I'll come back to for future Shabbats.
