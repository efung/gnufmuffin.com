I already have a favourite orange muffin, this [orange date muffin](/2005/10/orange-date-muffins.html)
which uses the **entire** orange, zest, pith, and all. But, when I see an interesting
idea, like including whole segments of citrus, I'm willing to give it a go.

The recipe is from [The Perfect Finish](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/399775/the-perfect-finish-by-bill-yossesmelissa-clark/9780393059533)
by Bill Yosses and Melissa Clark. I actually made this twice: the
first time, I didn't have all the ingredients, and did questionable
substitutions like using maple syrup instead of honey, and 2% milk
instead of half-and-half cream. That batch turned out to be dry,
and nearly burnt.  As other reviews have noted, **45 minutes** is
way too long to bake any muffin.

The next time, I had honey (ordered directly from [Dutchman's Gold](https://dutchmansgold.com/collections/honey)),
as well as cream. And I also knew to bake the muffins at slightly cooler temperature, and check it
at 25 minutes. They turned out much better. The crumb is very fine, and the orange segments
held together, without turning the surrounding cake into mush. However, the citrus flavour is 
lacking, despite all the zest. Maybe I'll just incorporate the idea of including whole segments into
my favourite recipe.
