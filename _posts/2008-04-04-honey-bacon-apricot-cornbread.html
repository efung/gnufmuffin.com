excerpt: "When I saw this recipe last month, I knew I had to try it: bacon in a cake! One cup of bacon was about 8 slices for me (note that the version that appears in the NY Times only calls for three. Pfft, wimps). Do grease and flour the pan, even if it is non-stick, as I didn't and the cake stuck. I drew"

One cup of bacon was about 8 slices for me (note that the version that appears in the NY Times only calls for three. Pfft, wimps). Do grease and flour the pan, even if it is non-stick, as I didn't and the cake stuck. I drew the line at drizzling bacon grease on the cake, and just served it with crumbled bacon, diced dried apricots and vanilla ice cream. It didn't go too well at work but I brought it to the Chowhound dinner where it seemed to be received very positively. The flavours are each quite prominent and contrasting. An interesting cornbread, in many ways.
