Date squares are something I grew up eating, as my Mom would make
them from time to time. The soft, sweet fruit and ever-so-slightly salty
crumble was pretty close to snack perfection. So these blueberry
bars were a revelation, that a similar square could be made
with fresh fruit.

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/05/jammy-fruit-bars.html),
by the wonderful Stella Parks (aka BraveTart) is really flexible. You
can use various kinds of juicy fruit (berries, stone fruit), or, some
jam from a jar. I used fresh blueberries from our farm box.

I remember that Stella's blueberry pie recipe uses **coriander**, which she teaches
is a [sympathetic aromatic](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/04/freeze-dried-fruit-adds-color-and-flavor-to-no-bake-cheesecake.html), bringing out the flavour of blueberries. So it was a surprise to
see cinnamon in this recipe.

This bar recipe is really, really good. We served it during a brunch and all the tasters 
liked it so much, I only got to try one square. A week later, I made another
batch, substituting freshly ground coriander for cinnamon. This second batch was also 
delicious: the toothsome oatmeal was a great contrast to the cooked fruit, and I liked
the hints of tartness and saltiness. I may have even had some for breakfast, two days in a row!
