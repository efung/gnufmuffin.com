After our annual apple picking excursion at Watson Farms, our 
thoughts naturally turned to what to do with all of the Golden 
Delicious and Cortlands that we took home. I found this 
hearty crumble with warm gingerbread flavours, and made it twice.

This [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019013-apple-gingersnap-crumble) definitely feeds a crowd: the yield is 12 servings, and
it works out to a half pound of apple per person. The filling has
a bit of cranberry for flavour and colour, and is dumped into a big dish:

Look how high the apples mound:

After 25 minutes in the oven, the apples start to give up some of their 
juices and the pile starts to compact:

While the apples are baking, you can make the topping. So many delicious
things go into it: ginger, cardamom, cloves, lemon zest, molasses!
There is a generous amount of topping and it browns very deeply in the
oven.

What a great crumble, so warm and satisfying! The leftovers don't hold 
that well as the topping absorbs the moisture very quickly. But
it was still yummy all mushed together.
