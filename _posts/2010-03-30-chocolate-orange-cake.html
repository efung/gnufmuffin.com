excerpt: "For the second night of Passover, I ended up making a chocolate orange cake, a little different than the one I made two years ago. This recipe uses oranges that have been boiled until soft, and the entire softened fruit is whizzed in the food processor along with all the other ingredients. I used Jaffa"

This recipe uses oranges that have been boiled until soft, and the entire softened fruit is whizzed in the food processor along with all the other ingredients. I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_orange">Jaffa oranges</a>, purchased on an expedition to <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/info-14417888-the-boys-farmers-market-incorporated-delray-beach">The Boys</a> in Delray Beach. We didn't have enough cocoa powder, so we incorporated some bittersweet chocolate chunks. One other major deviation was to omit the leaveners, as we weren't sure whether they were kosher for Passover. After cooling, I made a simple chocolate ganache and frosted the cake with it, pressing sliced almonds onto the side as a garnish.<br /><br />This cake was disappointing: it wasn't very chocolatey, but that could have been my fault for not having enough cocoa powder. I can't recall exactly, but I don't think it was super orangey either.  Repeating our success from the previous night, we also made an orange curd (with and without real sugar) to serve over pavlova nests.
