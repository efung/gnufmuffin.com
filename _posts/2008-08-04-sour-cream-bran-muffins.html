excerpt: "This issue of the magazine features the best-loved baked goods from the past decades. 1981 was the initial publication of this muffin recipe and it\'s still a delight. Of course, with &frac12; cup of butter and 1 cup of sour cream, it\'s bound to be delicious and rich. The molasses gave them a nice colour"

Of course, with &frac12; cup of butter and 1 cup of sour cream, it's bound to be delicious and rich. The molasses gave them a nice colour and I also added chopped walnuts to the batter for crunch. Like the other reviewers <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/SOUR-CREAM-BRAN-MUFFINS-13186">commented</a> on Epicurious, these were very light and moist, quite unlike most bran muffins.<br /><b>Update</b>: I made a batch replacing most of the sour cream with yogurt, and the raisins with one peeled, chopped apple. They turned out great.
