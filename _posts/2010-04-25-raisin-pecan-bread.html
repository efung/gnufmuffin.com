excerpt: "I'm always on the lookout for interesting ideas, and two things in this recipe caught my eye: raisin water and ground pecans. I used a stand mixer to knead the dough, and added the soaked raisins and nuts by hand, rolling it up like a jelly roll, then tucked the two ends under to form a ball. I worked"

I used a stand mixer to knead the dough, and added the soaked raisins and nuts by hand, rolling it up like a jelly roll, then tucked the two ends under to form a ball. I worked carefully to avoid any of the nuts puncturing the surface of the bread, where they might burn. Next time, I might try kneading by hand because it allows the raisins and nuts to be added with the flour (the dough hook would bash everything up if they were added during mixing).<br /><br />The loaf baked up beautifully brown as Beranbaum claimed. It was indeed a very tasty bread, and kept its moistness for days. You can't really taste the ground pecans, but they make the bread a little bit crumbly. The best part of a homemade loaf like this is that you are never left wanting for more raisins or nuts; this one is chock full of them! I will definitely make this again, despite the effort.
