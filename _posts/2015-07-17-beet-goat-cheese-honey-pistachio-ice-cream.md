Yes, this ice cream really does turn a beet salad into an ice cream.
This wasn't my [first](/2005/07/beet-ice-cream.html) vegetable-based
dessert, but it was definitely one of the most unusual.

Sam Mason, a chef from New York City, is the author of the
[recipe](http://blog.foodpairing.com/2015/05/nyc-chef-sam-masons-beet-goat-cheese-honey-pistachio-ice-cream/).
To get the beet liquid, I went to my local
[juice bar](https://www.facebook.com/theotherjuicebarintheonlycafe) and asked
them to juice some beets. These went into the ice cream base, along with
several forms of dairy, sugar and egg yolks. I made a few small
alterations: using about 5 oz of sugar, and only 4 oz of yolks in total.

The honeyed-pistachio-goat cheese mix-in recipe seemed excessive also,
so I cut back on both the nuts and honey. The churned base was nearly
spilling out of my KitchenAid canister, so I folded the goat cheese
mixture by hand in a large plastic container.

Despite my earnest promotion to friends and family, none of my tasters
really embraced this earthy ice cream. And truth be told, I must admit that 
root vegetables don't really appeal to me in a frozen dessert. The base
tastes distinctly of beets, and the tangy goat cheese didn't really
appeal to me either.
