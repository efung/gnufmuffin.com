At the library, I spied a title on ice cream that had beautiful photos, overlaid
with watercolour paintings and line drawings, a very unique look. On top of
that, the content was science-heavy: ingredient weights and percentages, and
deep dives into the chemistry of flavors and stabilizers. Definitely
my kind of book.

But what led us to take [_Hello, My Name Is Ice Cream_](https://www.hellomynameisicecream.com/)
by Dana Cree out of the 
library was my daughter's choice of dessert for her birthday: cream
cheese ice cream with gooey butter cake and candied lemon. This is
a multi-recipe [recipe](https://tastecooking.com/recipes/gooey-butter-cake-candied-lemon/)
that was relatively challenging. Here are the components:

<h3>Candied Lemon Bits</h3>
This turned out to be surprisingly complicated and I had to do it twice, <b>despite</b> reading
the warning about what could go wrong. 

The first step is easy, blanching the whole lemons three times.

Where this recipe differs from most is that it calls for candying the peel with the 
fruit still attached to the pith. After splitting the lemons end to end in quarters,
I let it simmer in the syrup for almost 3 hours. The fatal error in my first batch 
was leaving the kitchen with the burner set a bit too high. When I came back,
the syrup had big bubbles and had started to caramelize, meaning most of the water
had evaporated.

Sadly, the fruit peel was nearly inedible, darkening in colour, and
turning very hard and chewy in texture.  I salvaged this batch by
tossing the fruit, but saving the "caramelized lemon syrup", which
was delicious mixed with sparkling or plain ice water.

The second batch I made, I monitored the saucepan much more carefully, topping it up
with water every half hour (as suggested). This time, the lemons turned out wonderfully,
yielding to the bite and deliciously sweetened.

<h3>Gooey Butter Cake</h3>
This Midwestern dessert is a "St. Louis anomaly" according to Cree. It's super addictive,
especially when eaten at room temperature, but is also delicious frozen. The texture is
quite chewy, but it has incredible butter, caramel, and tart flavours.

It's actually two mini-recipes. The first is a cake layer that's patted into the bottom of 
a pan. I didn't have an 8x10 inch pan, so used a very deep pie pan.

The rest of the batter is called the "gooey layer" and contains cream cheese, eggs, butter,
and lots of flavourings: lemon zest, vanilla extract, and almond extract. This is poured over
the unbaked base.

What's supposed to happen is that the layers transform into a single cake. I'm not sure if that's
meant to be literally true, as mine still had distinct layers.

As it cooled, it sunk a bit.

The edges were more caramelized, and thus harder to cut into cubes. One batch makes way more than needed
for the ice cream, but we plan on mixing it into other ice creams over the summer. Little cubes 
are also an incredibly addictive sweet treat.

<h3>Cream Cheese Ice Cream</h3>
All of the ice cream bases in this book use glucose as one of the sweeteners, and always a mix of
dairies. In this one, you use both cream and milk, and also add cream cheese. Cree also gives a choice
of stabilizers: I used tapioca starch. No photo of the ice cream, sorry.

<h3>Assembly and Tasting</h3>
To make the composed scoop, I followed the author's advice on layering, and spread some of the freshly churned
ice cream on the bottom of the container, then sprinkled on diced candied lemon peel and cake chunks. After
repeating one more layer, I swirled them all gently with a chopstick.

What a delicious ice cream. Overall, it's quite sweet, but the cream cheese and lemon flavours tip it back
towards balance. I love lemon peel, so added even more bits to each serving I had.

The greatest discovery here might be the gooey butter cake. It's going to be such a great
mix-in for a variety of flavours.
