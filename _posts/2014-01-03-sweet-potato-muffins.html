excerpt: "I didn\'t do much baking over the holidays while in Florida, but did make this batch of muffins. Without a scale, I\'m not sure the quantity of sweet potato I used, but it was definitely more than called for, as the finished muffins were very soft and moist. Since I used the Splenda brown sugar mix,"

Without a scale, I'm not sure the quantity of sweet potato I used, but it was definitely more than called for, as the finished muffins were very soft and moist. Since I used the Splenda brown sugar mix, I can't really say that I enjoyed the flavour, but everyone who tried them said they were very, very good. As a substitute for the streusel topping, I just sprinkled some unsalted mixed nuts on top before baking.
