excerpt: "This is a great issue of the LCBO magazine that I\'ve hung on to for over a decade. It features three very different fruitcakes, all made without candied, glace fruit. As a thank you gift for friends who house- and cat-sit for us, I offered to make them the dried apple, ginger and Amaretto fruitcake."

It features three very different fruitcakes, all made without candied, glace fruit. As a thank you gift for friends who house- and cat-sit for us, I offered to make them the dried apple, ginger and Amaretto fruitcake. The only restriction to observe was to avoid rum for allergy reasons. <br /><br />I made a double batch (two loaves) and replaced some of the dates with chopped Brazil nuts. I waited until morning before wrapping in cheesecloth and brushing a generous amount of additional Amaretto over all. What a delicious fruitcake this turned out to be. It had a fine crumb, a little bit dry, but the blend of flavours and textures is magnificent. I already ate one loaf, sharing it with coworkers, and the other loaf for our friends will age for a few weeks.
