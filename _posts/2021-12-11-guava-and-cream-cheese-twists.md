For our final cookie of the week, we took guava paste (_pasta de guayaba_ in Spanish)
and put it in a cream cheese dough. Pretty simple, eh? These weren't 
bad, but they weren't that impressive either.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022703-guava-and-cream-cheese-twists) 
is from the 2021 holiday cookie collection in the New York Times, entitled [24 Days of Cookies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/30/dining/cookie-calendar.html).

On Saturday morning, my daughter and I went to [Perola's](https://www.perolassupermarket.com/) to pick
up the guava paste. 
At home, Dr. S made the dough, which resembled many [rugelach](/tag/rugelach/)
doughs since it incorporated cream cheese. After rolling it thin, she used a ruler
to measure out even rectangles, then placed a strip of the paste across diagonally.
My daughter helped to close them up. We skipped the chilling and decorating part.

After baking, I was surprised that the dough did not puff up and open up. This is
common with other cookies like hamantaschen, but I suppose the lack of any leavener
kept this cookie fairly flat.

I wanted to like this cookie more: the shape was interesting, and I like the use
of guava, something I don't normally keep on hand. But the filling got a little too
dark and chewy, and the cookie itself didn't have enough contrast in flavour.
