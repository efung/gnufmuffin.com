For a recent school bake sale, I made two winners from this year,
the [gochujang caramel cookies](/2023/02/gochujang-caramel-cookies.html)
and the [black sesame shortbread](/2023/01/black-sesame-shortbread.html).
To round out the selection, I made some squares using a grapefruit
curd. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment.

The [recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/3662-texas-pink-grapefruit-bars) comes from Cook's Country, one of America's Test Kitchen's
magazines. I liked that the cookie base used cardamom to enhance the
bittersweet flavour of grapefruit. But the curd was problematic.

Instead of red food colouring, I had the brilliant idea of using 
blood orange juice. I baked it a tad too long and it started to get
quite dark. And the colour changed as it baked as well. But the biggest
problem was that fresh grapefruit juice is not very tart and the full
amount of sugar made these tooth-achingly sweet.

I _really_ wanted to like these bars, so I tried it again a week later.
This time, I omitted Â½ cup sugar from the curd, doubled the lime juice,
and added even more blood orange juice. This time, the colour was less
dark, and the flavour more tangy. But I still didn't nail the grapefruit
flavour. Maybe more zest next time?
