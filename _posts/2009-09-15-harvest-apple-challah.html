Apples are a traditional part of the Jewish New Year celebrations, and a round challah is also common for Rosh Hashanah. Having made a <a href="/2008/01/apple-challah.html">previous loaf</a> from a different recipe, I knew that adding apples to egg bread would be a winning combination.<br /><br />This challah recipe is a little unusual because it uses the <a href="/2006/02/bread-5-chop-suey-bread-and-challah.html">chop suey</a> or monkey bread technique. After the dough is made and proofed, the apples are encased in a bread dough envelope. Using a knife or bench scraper, the entire thing is cut up into smaller pieces which are then placed in a cake tin.<br /><br />The trial loaf turned out quite well. It was tender and moist, with lots of apples. I found the egg flavour and colour to be lacking so I made the loaves for Friday using an additional egg. Leaving the skins on the apples wouldn't have been my preference, but I followed the directions as I thought doing otherwise would compromise the moisture level in the dough. The crown shape is a little unusual and I think I prefer the taste of a <i>milchig</i> loaf (like <a href="/2008/11/challah.html">this one</a>), but the challahs were well-received.<br /><br />King Arthur has some <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2008/09/26/taking-the-challah-challenge/">step-by-step</a> photos as well.
