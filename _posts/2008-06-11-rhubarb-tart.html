Unfortunately, while this recipe fit that requirement, I didn't find it all that tasty, especially for the amount of work required. The fruit is roasted in the oven with lots of sugar but I let it cook too long so the chunks fell apart too much. The crust was easy to make up in the food processor, but after rolling and baking, it shrunk a bit too much and was not quite cooked at the prescribed time. The filling is just cream cheese whipped with sweetened heavy cream, but the addition of rum wasn't enough to rescue it from mediocrity. A disappointing tart, but coworkers ate it anyway (!).
