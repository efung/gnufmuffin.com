The dough was prepared according to the recipe, but I deviated significantly for the filling. I spread the dough with sour cherry preserves, then sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar-nut mixture on top, followed by dried cherries soaked in kirschwasser and then chocolate chunks. This turned out to be a bit much, as the filling oozed out and burned on the parchment. It also made slicing difficult as one half batch was rolled too thinly and began to crack. You definitely want to make sure  that the dough is at least a quarter-inch thick. I skipped the step of rolling them in more cinnamon sugar (!). Despite my worries, the fresh rugelach right out of the oven was a hit, especially with the over-the-top touch of drizzled melted chocolate!
