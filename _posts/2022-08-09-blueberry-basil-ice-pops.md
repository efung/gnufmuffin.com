We put a variety of herbs in our [Balconera](https://www.lechuza.ca/en/home/) self-watering planters this year. The basil has done exceptionally
well, and when my wife bought a big container of blueberries, I
knew exactly what I wanted to make.

One of the most memorable sorbets I've ever had is the 
[blueberry basil](https://www.somachocolate.com/products/blueberry-basil-sorbet-factory-exclusive) flavour from [Soma](https://www.somachocolate.com/). I used to work in an office
a few steps away from their King St. store, and I once got a scoop
on a hot summer day. The two flavours were distinct and intense, yet
very complementary.

I decided to make ice pops instead, following two recipes from
[People's Pops](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/214907/peoples-pops-by-nathalie-jordi-david-carrell-and-joel-horowitz/). The blueberry and 
cardamom recipe called for one cup of simple syrup to 1 1/3 pounds of
blueberries. That ratio gave me the starting point for sweetness.
And the raspberry basil recipe provided the infusion recipe: 1 1/3 cups
of simple syrup to three 6-inch springs of basil.

Our basil is very fresh, but we found that the quantities above did not
make for a very intense basil flavour. We infused an additional bunch
of basil in some warm water, then stirred that into the ice pop mixture.

While these turned out wonderfully, I still wanted more basil flavour
to balance the blueberry. Next time, maybe I'll experiment with pureeing
some of the leaves right into the mixture.
