Muffins are often criticized as being little cakes, rather than a
healthy choice at breakfast. Many whole grain muffins indeed are 
loaded with sugar or topped with icings to compensate for their
coarseness. Thomas Keller's take on bran muffins falls somewhere 
in the middle, but are among the best I've had.

The
[recipe](http://www.foodieinnewyork.com/2014/01/16/moist-and-delicious-bran-muffins/)
from *Bouchon Bakery*
is one I've made three times now. The first time was back in November
when I first got the book: that attempt was a miserable failure. I had
difficulty adapting the recipe to regular sized tins, but held off on
buying new equipment.

Fast forward to this past week: I bought a jumbo tin holding 6 muffins,
and tried again, twice. First, the ingredients, clockwise from left: butter;
eggs mixed with molasses and honey; flour, wheat germ, wheat bran and
leaveners; buttermilk, half-and-half and water; pumpkin seeds, golden
raisins and pears (I used canned).

Sounds pretty good, right? I'm sure every bran muffin would be improved
with the addition of honey, cream and pears! Once
everything's assembled, we got started by creaming the butter and sugar:

Once mixed, the batter needs to rest in the refrigerator overnight, or
up to a day and a half. I messed up the first time, and forgot the
leaveners, and had to emergency-stir them into the completed batter.

The recipe specifies spraying the papers with pan spray, before filling
them just below the edge of the tin. Mine were pretty full.

Another screwup for the first attempt this week was not lowering the
oven temperature. Instead of reducing the 425&deg;F down to 325&deg;F, I
let the muffins bake for 20 minutes before realizing my mistake. They
turned out fine, if a little dark on top. This is the result of the
second, more careful batch:

As they say, the third time's the charm. These bran muffins don't taste
"healthy" but you don't feel guilty after eating them. They're light and
moist, with lots of interesting things in each bite. Even with the overnight
refrigeration, lengthy ingredient list and small yield, I'd make these
again.
