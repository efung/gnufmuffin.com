Most sweet recipes for [rhubarb](/tag/rhubarb/) usually pair the
stalks with strawberry, so it's noteworthy to me when I see a recipe
using the plant on its own. As you would expect from the [Bouchon
Bakery](/tag/bouchon-bakery/) book, this tart wasn't simple but,
boy, did it deliver on taste.

The first step in the
[recipe](http://www.hintofvanillablog.com/home/2013/04/rhubarb-and-brown-butter-tart.html)
was to prepare the cured rhubarb. The peeled stalks need to be macerated
in a syrup made with grenadine (which I naively tried to find at
the liquor store). This is supposed to colour it somewhat, but the bright
green stalks I used remained bright green after the curing process.
The only place I've seen the more tender, thinner, and redder stalks,
are at farmer's markets. Also, the recipe calls for two pounds of
rhubarb, this is about double what you actually need for one tart.

The base of the tart is actually a crisp, blind baked _pâte sucrée_.
Bouchon's version uses vanilla bean seeds as well as almond flour.
Note that the recipe in the book makes enough for **two** rhubarb
tarts, i.e. you'll only need one of the 4"⨉6" dough blocks. The
shell shrunk quite a bit during baking, so make sure to overfill
the base slightly when you roll it out.

To make the filling, you need to make brown butter. I found it easiest
to measure the amount I needed by straining it through a small piece of
cheesecloth, set in a strainer, over a glass measuring cup.

The filling is easy to put together, but just be sure your eggs and
dairy ingredients are at room temperature, to ensure the melted
brown butter doesn't solidify. I didn't bother with putting the
filling into a piping bag, it's easier to just pour it over the
rhubarb and spread it with an offset spatula.

After a long bake, sufficient to brown the top, you cut the tart into
small rectangles. You're also supposed to garnish it with a streusel
and powdered sugar, but that seemed like too much. This rhubarb tart is
_phenomenal_ on its own. The buttery and nutty filling is a great
complement to the tart and soft rhubarb, and the sturdy crust holds
it all together. The only thing I would change is to underbake the
base in the future, as I didn't like the cracker-like consistency
it developed.
