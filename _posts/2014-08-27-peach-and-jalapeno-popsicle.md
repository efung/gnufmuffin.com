Another day, another peach post. This time, a spicy popsicle!

From the wonderful People's Pops recipe book, comes this
[recipe](http://barbarajoycesheldon.blogspot.ca/2014/06/peach-and-jalapeno-ice-pops.html).
They have a standard formula for fruit/herb pops, which combines an
infused simple syrup with roasted fruit.

I really liked this. The chili heat arrives after the cold, sweet and tangy 
flavour starts to melt away. It reminded me of how the [chocolate chili ice
cream](/2007/06/chocolate-chili-ice-cream.html) also changes on your
tongue. Maybe a smoked, astringent, dried chili would be an even better
counterpart in this recipe.
