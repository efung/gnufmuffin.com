Faced with a lot of milk at its best before date, I did what 
any sane person would do and made condensed milk: two batches, in fact.
Read on to see how we used 8 litres of milk in just a few days.

Key lime pie is a wonderful sweet-tart dessert associated with those
tiny, hard-to-squeeze citrus fruits. But I prefer using regular limes,
as they're so much easier to juice. And, according to Stella Parks, 
Florida might not have any claim to the dessert anyway. I used the
[recipe](https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2017/10/02/magic-key-lime-pie)
from her cookbook, which calls for making your own condensed milk and
graham crackers!

The [crackers](https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2017/10/02/crispy-whole-wheat-graham-crackers) 
are made with 100% whole wheat flour, sweetened with honey,
and gently spiced with cinnamon. There's quite a bit of baking soda to
keep them crisp. Do keep an eye them, as I think 20 minutes at 350&deg;F
is too long. My batches got very dark at the edges.

Making the [quick condensed milk](https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2017/10/04/quick-condensed-milk) was simple but requires constant stirring. 
Stella's trick is to use heavy cream to prevent burning. It was 
delicious, as expected, and did not have that strong dairy flavour that 
the canned stuff often has. We also made a batch of the chai spiced 
version that my daughter and I enjoyed for a week, to make an easy chai
latte.

But back to the pie: aside from making the condensed milk yourself, 
the custard is like any other key lime pie. We didn't have four hours
to chill it, so the first evening we served the pie, the slices were a bit 
runny. But the leftovers didn't last long. I thought the flavour was 
delicious, but wanted more filling and less crust. Maybe I'll use a 
slightly smaller dish next time, or make the crust a tad thinner.
This is a very impressive dessert to make, if you like scratch baking.
