Good thing I anticipated this and baked it over a tray. The recipe calls for 2 cups of mashed bananas and one cup of buckwheat flour, so this is a good way to use up those ingredients. The texture is very crumbly, with a light banana flavour. An interesting variation, but it doesn't surpass my <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2005/09/chteau-banana-bread.html">favourite</a>.<br /><br /><b>Update (2008-10-20)</b>: I recently made this replacing the shortening with an equal weight of lard, using a 12-cup muffin tin and an 8&times;4" loaf pan. It worked quite nicely.
