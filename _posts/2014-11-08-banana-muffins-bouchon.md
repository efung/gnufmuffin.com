I love a good deal, and when I saw a used copy of [Bouchon
Bakery](/tag/Bouchon%20Bakery) online, I bought it right away.
Thomas Keller has a number of restaurants that I've
never eaten at, save for one brunch at [Bouchon
Bistro](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/4843552858/in/set-72157624615076766)
in Vegas. But the book's photographs, precise recipes and the authors'
reputations were compelling enough for me to make the banana muffins
*three* times over the past week.

The
[recipe](http://www.mission-food.com/2014/02/bouchon-bakery-banana-muffins.html)
has an ingredient list and measurement precision that indicate it's been
scaled down from a commercial bakery recipe. So as long as you have a
digital scale, it should just be as easy to measure 168g of flour, as it is
to scoop out 1&frac14; cup + 1 tbsp! For the leaveners, though, my scale
isn't precise enough to measure fractions of a gram, so I just used the
volume measurements.

There were a few practical substitutions I made: vanilla extract for
vanilla paste, and buttermilk for crème fraîche. The quantities of these
ingredients were small enough that I didn't think they would affect
texture or taste. As the yield was only 6 jumbo muffins, I made a double
batch. The streusel recipe itself makes *way* more than you need for one
batch of muffins, about four times as much.

Since I didn't have jumbo muffin tins, I lined my regular large
ones with silicone cups. After an overnight rest in the fridge, I
made the first batch (about 9 large muffins). They turned out not
fully cooked at the 35 minute mark despite the smaller cup size. I
don't know whether this is my wonky oven, or an overly wet batter
or something else. The muffin itself was extremely moist and tender,
and wet enough that they didn't release cleanly from the silicone.
Instead of providing a nice crunch, the streusel sank into the batter
and melded into the muffin tops.

The following morning, I baked the remaining batter, but deposited more
in each cup, and leaving the tin in for a longer time in the oven.
Not surprisingly, these turned out pretty much the same. This time, they
were larger (obviously) and held more of the streusel.

Not content with these results, and refusing to believe that the recipe
would turn out less than spectacularly, I made one more batch later in
the week with a few more changes. I lined the tin with paper cups, then 
sprayed them with pan release, and I raised the oven temperature to
340&deg;F. This batch turned out the best thus far, well-cooked and
browned, but still moist and tender.

I can't help but wonder whether using jumbo muffin cups would improve
the results of these muffins. But the last thing our kitchen needs
is another baking pan. I plan to try all the muffin recipes in this
book (in fact, I already made the bran ones but need to try it a
few more times) and will document my experiments here, of course.

**Update**: On a work trip to New York City a week later, I stayed
in Manhattan not far from a [Bouchon
Bakery](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/15786785805/in/photostream/).
I was disappointed to find that the Rockefeller Center location
didn't sell banana muffins, so I tried a blueberry muffin. It was
a very good muffin, but my life was not changed.
