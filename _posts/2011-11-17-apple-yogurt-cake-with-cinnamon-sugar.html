Last week, my mother-in-law flew in before we landed, stocked our fridge and helped us to take care of Gabe while we adjusted to the time change. This week, we were still eating things out of the fridge, so I went looking for a recipe that would use up some of the contents.<br /><br />This recipe turned out to be so good that I made it twice this week. The most time-consuming part is peeling, coring and dicing the apples. Once that's done, the rest of the cake is pretty simple. Instead of olive oil, I used sunflower seed oil, and I replaced a half cup of the AP flour with whole wheat flour. What a wonderful cake! It's moist and full of apple flavour, with occasional hits of cinnamon sugar. Definitely one to make again.
