My copy says Canadian Pacific Hotels (now Fairmont) and Ch창teau Laurier (I think) so it's likely from the hotel chain. This is an incredibly flavourful cake, with a rich deep brown colour that only comes from the long baking time at a low temperature. From the original 7 tsp baking soda on my copy, I've reduced it down to 5 tsp: the recipe in the link uses only 3 tsp. If you've ever been disappointed by a pale and ho-hum banana bread, try this recipe.
