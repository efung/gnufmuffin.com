I would wager that most people have the same image in mind when
they think of peanut butter cookies, a small, crumbly disc, criss-crossed
with indentations from the tines of a fork. When I saw a recipe
for a different kind of giant, chewy PB cookie, I had to try them.

That wasn't the only reason though: I've had leftover peanut brittle 
laying around from a [previous project](/2017/03/pb-and-j-saltine-panna-cotta.html),
which is one of the ingredients in these cookies. The 
[recipe](https://butter-tree.blogspot.ca/2011/11/it-brought-me-right-back.html) comes
from the [Momofuku](/tag/momofuku/) [Milk Bar](/tag/milk-bar/) cookbook.

First, a few bench notes. Glucose is a bit messy to work with, and leaves a sticky
residue on the side of the mixer bowl. Using "non-natural" peanut butter was
a big change for me, as I'm so used to the texture and flavour of natural PB. But
Tosi insists on the hydrogenated kind for this recipe.

I made two separate batches of these cookies over the past week.
The first time, I put eight on each half sheet pan, with a total
yield of 20 cookies.  This resulted in cookies that ran into each
other and were really flat.

The second time (pictured), I aimed for 15 cookies, didn't flatten
them as much, and only put six per half sheet pan. These turned out
thicker, with the promised crispy exterior and chewy interior.
