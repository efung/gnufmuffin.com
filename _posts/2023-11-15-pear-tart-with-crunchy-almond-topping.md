Something a bit different, something to use up ingredients, something
a little impressive, something not too laborious: that would be the
pillars of my baking philosophy. This tart was all of those things,
and good enough that I made it twice this month.

Dorie Greenspan is the author of the [recipe](https://people.com/food/baking-chez-moi-cookbook-review/) and I found it in her book, _Baking Chez Moi_.
The sweet tart dough (_pâte sucrée_) is one of the easiest I've ever made.
I used the pat-in method, smoothing and flattening the crumbs with the 
tamper from our espresso machine. It browns quite easily in the oven,
and I needed a foil shield around the edges, after I removed the foil
during the first step.

For the filling, don't use pears that are overly ripe if you want a
crisp crust. Otherwise, their juiciness will end up softening your
pastry after a few days. There's not a lot to do here except bathing
the diced fruit in hot butter, and hitting it with some sugar and 
brandy. The topping is what makes this tart special though: a mix of
egg white and icing sugar to coat the sliced almonds. Piled atop the
fruit, it browns and becomes glossy, and provides a really nice crunch.

I was thrilled with how delicious this tart was, and how easy it was
to make. The pears are the main focus, but the crunchy almonds steal the
show. Highly recommended.
