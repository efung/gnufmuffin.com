I'm not a huge brownie fan, as evidenced by the lack of [brownie
posts](/tag/brownies) on this site. My preference falls somewhere in the middle of
the fudgey vs. cakey spectrum. I also like nuts in my brownies,
especially walnuts. But an ingredient surplus combined
with a magazine recipe led to this weekend's dessert project, cream
cheese brownies.

The [recipe](http://heatherhomemade.com/2014/06/cream-cheese-brownies/)
I used comes from the July/August 2014 issue of 
[Cook's Illustrated](/tag/cook%27s-illustrated/). This isn't
the first time the magazine has tackled this exact treat (they published
a recipe in January 1999), but they somehow felt a need to recycle the topic and
improve on it some more.

Making the cream cheese filling was easy. I incorporated the sour cream
all at once, instead of tempering it gradually, and ended up with small
lumps in the mixture. This didn't affect the final product though. I
made one small change to the batter, based on a discussion in the article. 
Instead of four ounces of unsweetened chocolate, I replaced half with
bittersweet chocolate, reducing the sugar to 1 cup.

The marbling process is a bit fussy: you need to spread the batter and
filling evenly, then microwave some of the batter, drop it over the
base, then swirl them together. I needed the full 40 minutes of baking
time.

All in all, this brownie turned out alright. Good balance of sweet and
tangy, and the 2" serving size is just right. I wrapped each square
individually with the foil used to line the pan, and now have a bag of 
them in the freezer, ready for whenever a brownie craving strikes.
