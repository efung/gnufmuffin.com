There's many reasons to like waffles: the crisp and soft textural duality, the 
indentations to hold syrup and fruit, the guilty pleasure of making them with a 
unitasking appliance. They're not _uncommon_ at our household, but I do like
to try a new variation from time to time. On this Sunday, I tried a cornmeal
one that got high marks for flavour, but was too much work.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6373-cornmeal-waffles) is due
to [Craig Claiborne](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/24/nyregion/craig-claiborne-79-times-food-editor-and-critic-is-dead.html) and [Pierre Franey](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/16/nyregion/pierre-franey-whose-lifelong-love-food-led-career-chef-author-dies-75.html). It's unusual in that you need to cook the cornmeal
into a partial mush before using it.

Next, you make the rest of the batter like a cake, by alternating
the addition of the dry and wet ingredients. Instead of vegetable
shortening, which I did not have, I used coconut oil at room
temperature. At the end, you add in beaten egg whites. I combined
everything in the cooled saucepan. No extra bowl to clean!

These waffles baked up nice and golden. But it turns out that the 
coconut oil I used had too strong of a flavour for my children.

Was this a perfectly acceptable, tasty (notwithstanding the coconut flavour),
and satisfying way to begin a Sunday? Yes. But the work in cooking
the cornmeal, and whipping egg whites, was just a bit too much effort.
I'm not saying I wouldn't make this again, but it wouldn't be my first
choice.
