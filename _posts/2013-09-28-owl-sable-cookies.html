excerpt: "The astute reader would notice that these photos were taken towards the end of August, a full month before this post is being published. Why the delay? Because I made them for the first of five interviews I had, and had to keep mum until I knew the outcome!To make these owls, I started with two batches"

Why the delay? Because I made them for the first of five interviews I had, and had to keep mum until I knew the outcome!<br /><br />To make these owls, I started with two batches of the CI sablé recipe, plain and chocolate. The dough incorporates cooked egg yolks, to achieve a sandy texture, a technique I recall from the <a href="/2005/11/mozart-cake.html">Mozart cake</a> (8 years ago!!!). After slicing the rolled logs, I based my design on the ideas from <a href="http://emmakat79.blogspot.ca/2011/03/parliament-of-vegan-owl-cookies.html">Emmakat</a>, using contrasting doughs to get the basic owl shape, then used a cashew for the nose, and mini chocolate chips for the pupils. For a fun touch, I melted a bit of chocolate and piped eye details on a few of the owls.<br /><br />And what happened with the interviews? I'm pleased to announce that I have accepted a job offer with a very fun company. This recruiting video will explain the owls:<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dwSe2imUyvg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />
