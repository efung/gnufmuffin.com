A traditional strudel is something I've never attempted before. The
pastry is difficult to make: I recall reading about some bakers
using the edge of a table, to hang and stretch the dough into a
paper-thin layer. This month's issue of [Cook's
Illustrated](/tag/cook%27s-illustrated/) offered a strudel made with phyllo
that I thought be a quick weeknight dessert.

The [recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9244-apple-strudel)
is found in the November 2016 magazine. As with the previous recipe
Cook's published back in 2003 (which I've made
[before](/2014/10/easy-apple-strudel.html)), it calls for phyllo
dough. This time, they make a few improvements including using the microwave 
to pre-cook the apples, dusting each sheet of buttered phyllo with confectioner's
sugar to prevent the baked layers from flying apart, and keeping the rolled seam on top to
avoid a thick bundle on the underside.

Hot out of the oven, this was absolutely delicious. The phyllo
developed a nice browned exterior (the reserved apple liquid is
brushed on before baking) and the apples were nicely tender. Leftovers
were decidedly less tasty: the phyllo absorbed the liquid and became
soft and unappetizing.

The most time-consuming part of this recipe was the layering of the
phyllo, but it's otherwise very straightforward. One day, I'll
attempt a strudel from scratch, maybe by following this 
[Serious Eats recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/how-to-make-real-deal-austrian-strudel.html).
