excerpt: "The spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, white pepper) and honey (Dutchman\'s Gold Summer Blossom) are the flavourings for this classic French cookie. I bought the madeleine tins from Design &amp; Realisation. I noticed this recipe calls for a hot oven (425&deg;F) while all the other recipes I have use"

I bought the madeleine tins from <a href="http://www.dr.ca/">Design &amp; Realisation</a>. I noticed this recipe calls for a hot oven (425&deg;F) while all the other recipes I have use a more moderate temperature. The little sponge cakes baked in the minimum time and were quite brown on the edges. No problems with removal, as I made sure to butter and flour the pans. The cakes were a little too sweet, but that is due to the particular honey I used I'm sure. My tasters all detected the subtle spicing, but it wasn't too overwhelming. A nice first experiment.
