There were plenty of reviews for this <i>Good Eats</i> recipe, and I whipped up this cake with the help of a food processor. It's a little unusual in that it uses yogurt. I drastically reduced the amount of sugar called for, from 10 ounces to 5. I also added some toasted walnuts. While this carrot cake was moist and flavourful, it's nothing special. Oh, and it still tasted sweet enough, despite using half the sugar called for.
