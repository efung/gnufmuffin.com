I was invited to lead a virtual baking class for a team social event
recently. That got me thinking about what sweet treat
would require a minimum of equipment and ingredients, could be 
assembled in an hour, and could be customized to everyone's taste.

A year into the pandemic, my first thought was to see what star
bakers were doing online. I knew that [Christina Tosi](https://www.christinatosi.com/)
started a baking club on Instagram Live, but I never joined in
because it took place on a weekday afternoon. Fortunately,
there's an archive of her [recordings](https://www.instagram.com/christinatosi/) 
and [recipes](https://www.christinatosi.com/recipes).

In the end, I settled on these oat cookie bars 
([recipe](https://www.christinatosi.com/post/oatmeal-cookie-bars)
and [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-LL6UxJV6P/?hl=en)). They
could be made with or without an electric mixer, had wheat substitutes,
and allowed for various mixins.

In my trial batch, I creamed the butter by hand, since I didn't know
if my colleagues had small kitchen appliances. I used old-fashioned
rolled oats, and wheat flour. Tosi's recipe and video instructions
give advice for using quick oats, and non-wheat substitutes. My
mixins were several tablespoons of natural peanut butter and raspberry
jam. I used an 8" metal pan, so the bars came out a bit thick.
Still warm from the oven, our household quickly devoured half the tray.

For the online session, I switched to a quarter sheet pan,
and different mixins (almond butter, apricot jam, hazelnuts). This
one turned out slightly crispier, and not quite as satisfying as the
PB&J one. I was pleased that everyone reported success and yummy
results.

Highly recommended, whether you're teaching a class online, or baking
with kids! This recipe is easy and satisfying.
