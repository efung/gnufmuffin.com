These peanut-butter filled oatmeal sandwich cookies looked simple,
but this weekend project ended up being spread over three days.

The [recipe](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Better-Nutters)
comes from [Bouchon Bakery](/tag/bouchon-bakery/), and is the latest
stop in my random walk through the book. It's based on the [Nutter
Butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutter_Butter) which Wikipedia
tells me has been on the market for over 40 years. I've never had one
before, and don't plan to either.

There are three components to make: the buttercream, the filling, and
the cookie dough. Since the buttercream makes more than twice what's
needed in the filling, and it's hard to make a small batch of
buttercream, I doubled up on the cookies. The dough is extremely
soft and sticky when it's close to room temperature. 

After chilling the completed dough, I needed to re-chill it after
rolling it flat, since it had gotten so sticky.  I didn't have a
3" cookie cutter, so I made one batch using a 3Â¾" cutter, but these
were really, really big. The next batch, I made using 2" cutters
(that's what you see in the photos).

I've made Italian meringue buttercream before, so I had no trouble with
that. After making the peanut butter filling, I realized that this batch
of cookies utilized more than 500g of peanut butter. Bring on the
calories.

My schedule ended up something like:

- Saturday afternoon: make cookie dough, shape into flat square, chill
- Sunday: roll dough, chill, make buttercream, cut cookies out, chill
- Monday: bake off cookies, make filling, chill, pipe filling

I give these cookies a thumbs up on taste, but a thumbs down for effort.
The cookie dough is very hard to work with, and requires constant
chilling, while the filling requires making a buttercream.
