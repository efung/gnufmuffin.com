excerpt: "In preparation for a wine, cheese and dessert post-wedding reception we were hosting at the house, I made these bars ahead of time and froze them. They weren\'t very much work at all to make. Instead of key limes, which I find frustrating to juice because of their size, I used regular limes. It\'s best"

They weren't very much work at all to make. Instead of key limes, which I find frustrating to juice because of their size, I used regular limes. It's best to cut these while very cold or partially frozen as the top is a little sticky. These were a big hit, every single bar was eaten before the end of the night!
