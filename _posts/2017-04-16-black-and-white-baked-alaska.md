Back home in Toronto, we were still avoiding wheat, so when we had guests
coming over, I needed a dessert made without flour. Dorie Greenspan's 
[Baking Chez Moi](/tag/baking-chez-moi/) has a number of recipes that fit
the bill, but the one that caught my eye was a retro classic, a baked Alaska.

When I say classic, I don't mean classic for _me_, as I didn't grow up
eating it. I mean that it's a dessert that can be traced back 200 years
according to a fascinating 
[article from NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/29/469957638/baked-alaska-a-creation-story-shrouded-in-mystery). The [recipe](http://cdn.app.theweek.com/node/30484) has three components.
First up is baking the brownie-like base. It's made from melted dark chocolate,
butter, sugar, cocoa, egg yolks, and whipped egg whites.

Once that layer has cooled, you spread a pint (or two!) of softened ice cream over the base.
We used Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia. Back it went into the freezer.

Before our guests arrived, I had time to make the topping. This is a simple Swiss
meringue (where the egg whites and sugar are heated over a double boiler). I used
a closed star tip to make a design, ensuring that all of the ice cream was covered
in an insulating blanket.

Once everyone was finished dinner, I popped back into the kitchen to
preheat the oven, and took the unbaked Alaska out. To get a nice brown colour,
I needed the full 5 minutes at 500Â°F.

This cake was very well received. I loved how chocolatey the bottom chewy layer was, 
and how the cold ice cream and soft meringue provided a contrast in every forkful.
Perhaps this retro dessert will make an appearance at Pesach 2018.
