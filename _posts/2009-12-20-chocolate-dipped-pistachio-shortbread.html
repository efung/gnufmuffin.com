It is easily made using food processor (to grind the oatmeal) and mixer (to make the dough). The use of the springform collar didn't seem to make much difference for me, as the cookie dough never spread right to the edge. After the drying period in the turned-off oven, the cookies were very, very crumbly and broke apart easily. Make sure you score deeply enough so that separating the fingers is easier.<br /><br />I made another batch of this as well, using ground hazelnuts. Unless you or your eaters have nut allergies, I really recommend this addition. A fine holiday cookie that's not too much work.
