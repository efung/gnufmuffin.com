A sweet-smoky combo in a crumbly shortbread? Mmm, sounds good to me.
Unfortunately, these turned out sub-optimally.

The recipe is from _Fabulous Modern Cookies_ and calls for rice flour
and smoked almonds (I used a tin from Blue Diamond). The dough
is very crumbly, but the fun part is just patting it all into a 
sheet pan.

Here is where I think there's a problem with the recipe or a problem
with my oven: it says to bake it at 350&deg;F on a low rack for 
27 to 35 minutes. At minimum time, it was quite dark at the edges
and the butterscotch chips looked more like chocolate chips! I would 
start checking at the 15 minute mark next time.

I was surprised that the whole slab held together as I inverted it.
As expected, it was overcooked, and ended up being hard, rather than
crunchy. Still, I love the flavours and would try it again.
