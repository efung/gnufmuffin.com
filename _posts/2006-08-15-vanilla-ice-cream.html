The recipe I used is fairly standard, using eight yolks to a quart of cream; I've seen some using a dozen! My canister of vanilla sugar had exactly one cup of sugar left plus 4 &ldquo;previously enjoyed&rdquo; beans so I dumped all of that into the custard mixture along with the seeds of a fresh bean. As I had hoped, this ice cream was the best vanilla I've ever tasted: very rich, creamy, wonderful mouth feel with intense flavour. Pictured is the ice cream mixed with pecan praline (made with leftover garnish from <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2006/02/cocoa-nests-with-caramel-mousse.html">this</a> dinner party dessert). I also made maple walnut by mixing in syrup and crumbled deep-fried sweetened walnuts from <a href="http://www.tnt-supermarket.com/main-e.php">TNT</a> Supermarket).
