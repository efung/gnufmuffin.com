One idea I had was to make a pound cake filled with those honey-glazed walnuts you can get at T&amp;T Supermarket. I used the traditional pound cake recipe from the George Brown <a href="/2005/09/cake-1-pound-cakes.html">class I took years ago</a>, which uses both butter and shortening. I added almost a cup of toasted walnuts, plus a small container, maybe half cup, of the honey-glazed walnuts. The cakes (two 9" loaves) took a long time to bake, and perhaps I overbaked it, as it was a bit dry. Also, I should have covered the cake with foil before letting it bake longer. The walnut flavour is not pronounced enough for my liking. I would toast the nuts longer, or use more of the T&amp;T nuts next time.
