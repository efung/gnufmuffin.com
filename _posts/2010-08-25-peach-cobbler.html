excerpt: "With the last bowl of peaches bought from our trip to Niagara-on-the-Lake, I whipped up this peach cobbler. It was very easy to come together, the longest part being the peeling of all the peaches. Due to scheduling difficulties, I let the fruit macerate for a whole day in the fridge. They turned out"

It was very easy to come together, the longest part being the peeling of all the peaches. Due to scheduling difficulties, I let the fruit macerate for a whole day in the fridge. They turned out a little softer than I would have liked, but were still delicious. The biscuits were very light and fluffy. Altogether, I like how this recipe doesn't mask the pure flavour of the fruit. Leftovers do not hold well: this is best eaten within two days.
