excerpt: "I got these hollow truffle shells from a cake decorating supply store. The tray is very flimsy so be careful when picking it up! Using a plain bittersweet chocolate ganache as a base, I added a small tin of sweetened chestnut purée. Let the filling cool until it is pipeable, then fill the shells completely."

The chestnut flavour is too subtle to be detected. I would use milk chocolate couverture next time.
