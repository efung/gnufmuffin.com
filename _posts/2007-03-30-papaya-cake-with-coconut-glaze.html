excerpt: "The recipe conveniently omits the time it takes to reduce the cooked papaya puree down to 1 cup: about 40 minutes! After enduring hot, tropical fruit sputtering onto my arms, I thought baby food might be a shortcut for next time. Dried pineapples are very expensive, more so if you buy the organic kind"

After enduring hot, tropical fruit sputtering onto my arms, I thought baby food might be a shortcut for next time. Dried pineapples are very expensive, more so if you buy the organic kind like <a href="http://www.levelground.com/frutos.php">these</a>. I reduced the granulated sugar by half; this didn't affect the cake's taste too much. While the cake was moist, tender and full of rummy pineapple bits, the normally strong-tasting papaya lost its flavour after baking, leaving only its colour behind. An interesting idea, but the prep work is too labour-intensive.
