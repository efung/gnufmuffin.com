We went to [Andrews' Scenic Acres](http://www.andrewsscenicacres.com/) in Milton
on the weekend. Dr. S was sick at home, so I took my two kids and met up
with my parents, for a morning of strawberry, cherry, and raspberry picking.
The warm weather naturally led to thoughts of a very cold dessert, like frozen
yogurt.

The [recipe](https://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/frozen-yogurt) comes from
the July 2016 issue of Cook's Illustrated. In it, the authors caution against
using Greek yogurt which has a low water content, but churns up chalky
and crumbly. Instead, they employ a number of techniques to reduce the amount
of water and to prevent the remaining liquid from turning into ice crystals.

I drained the (non-Greek) yogurt for 24 hours, but this was just
out of convenience (the recipe calls for 8 to 12 hours). Making this recipe
is otherwise pretty uncomplicated: pureeing some ripe strawberries, and 
stirring the sugar and corn syrup into the yogurt.

Eaten directly out of the ice cream maker, this treat was deliciously
creamy and tangy, perhaps as good a regular ice cream (gasp). After
an overnight freeze, however, it was hard and waxy, and needed a lot
longer than 10 minutes to soften enough to a scoopable consistency.
In the end, I needed short blasts in a microwave to make it servable.
