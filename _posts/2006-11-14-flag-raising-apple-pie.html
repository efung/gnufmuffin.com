excerpt: "The crust (butter and shortening) is easy to work with, but the quantity is barely enough to line a 9\" pie plate. I used a mix of Northern Spy and Fortune apples; the latter are called Longo\'s apple at Longo\'s (?). For the streusel topping, I replaced almost all of the sugars with leftover pecan praline"

I used a mix of Northern Spy and <a href="http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/comm/apples/fortune/index.html">Fortune</a> apples; the latter are called Longo's apple at <a href="http://www.longos.com/eng/homepage.asp?flash=no">Longo's</a> (?). For the streusel topping, I replaced almost all of the sugars with leftover pecan praline that I food-processed into a sandy consistency. Finally (after several recent disappointments), an apple pie that I enjoyed eating: a little too tart (needs a bit more sugar), but the apple flavour came through, and the nutty topping is delicious.
