excerpt: "As a slightly fancy dessert for a pizza party we held on Friday, I made these edible ice cream containers. I skipped the step of browning the butter, but followed the directions otherwise. It\'s difficult to get the batter to an even thickness without one of those wooden tools they use for making crepes."

I skipped the step of browning the butter, but followed the directions otherwise. It's difficult to get the batter to an even thickness without one of those wooden tools they use for making crepes. Thin areas brown faster, and thick areas make it difficult to shape and don't have a nice mouth-feel. In fact, the shaping was the hardest part about making these. Dr. S and I tried various techniques: draping them over the bottom of glass tumblers, placing them over the bottoms of muffin tins, fitting them into small glass custard dishes. They do harden very quickly so you have to work fast. They were a little too sweet though, but I would make them again as a fun serving dish.
