The farmer's markets now have heaps of cherries, both sweet and sour
varieties. We bought some Morello cherries this week, a dark-fleshed
tart variety, and stained our hands red pitting them to make desserts
post-dinner.

Our first project in the week was a  
[cobbler](/2008/07/fresh-sour-cherry-cobbler.html) that we've
made in the past, but a quick Internet search turned up this
[recipe](http://www.marthastewart.com/318111/sour-cherry-pistachio-crisp).

This turned out beautifully, with the topping browned and crisp and full
of oatmeal and pistachio bits. The filling was quite tart and juicy, too
runny for my liking, but my wife and brother-in-law declared it just
right.
