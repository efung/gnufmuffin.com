After my last experiment at infusing chocolates with jasmine tea, I was more pleased with the results of this recipe. The ganache is very very soft: I could barely pick up a square after it had been drying overnight at room temperature. I see why having the foot is useful. Sprinkling a bit of matcha on top sounded like a good idea, but it dissolved into dark spots.
