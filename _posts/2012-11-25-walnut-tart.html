There were a few dishes I tried (e.g. an egg curry) but an article on sweet tarts by Daley was what made me hang on to that issue.<br /><br />I finally got to make one of the recipes recently, a walnut tart (<i>taste grenobloise</i>, in French). The accompanying flavour was coffee, so a bitter+bitter combination was expected. Instead of making a pâte brisée, I just used a frozen disc of vodka pie crust.<br /><br />The tart was a bit disappointing: it was a bit soft and runny, and not as delicious as a pecan pie. A fine variation to have up my sleeve, but not one I'd quickly make again.
