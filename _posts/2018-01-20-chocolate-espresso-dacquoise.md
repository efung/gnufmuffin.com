For a school "parent party" we went to on Saturday night, we
volunteered to make a dessert. I had several potential candidates
in mind the night before, and settled on one of the most time-consuming
recipes on Saturday morning. It was well worth the effort though,
as this cake featured brittle nut meringue, coffee buttercream,
chocolate glaze, all combined in an impressive package.

The [recipe](http://www.treats-sf.com/2013/11/chocolate-espresso-dacquoise-and-cooks.html)
comes from Cook's Illustrated's November 2012 issue. The first component was the 
almond-hazelnut meringue. It was a breeze to make in a stand mixer, but the
time-consuming part was baking and cooling it. I could have made it the night before,
had I not felt so tired.

While the meringue was drying in the oven, I worked on the pastry cream. The
helpful recipe developers decided to employ a 
[German buttercream](http://bravetart.com/recipes/GermanButtercream)
to avoid having leftover egg yolks. While this part was straightforward,
combining the chilled pastry cream with the butter was a bit problematic.
I think I incorporated the fat too quickly, and didn't allow for enough
whipping time as my buttercream wasn't creamy, and didn't emulsify 
properly.

After making the chocolate ganache, I was ready for final assembly. Sawing
the big rectangle of meringue was a tense affair, but I made it through 
without any significant breakage. Do measure carefully though. If you want 
the stack to be perfect, each long rectangle has to be exactly the same width.
I followed the recommended ½ cup of buttercream, and ¼ cup of ganache per 
layer, to ensure that I would have enough to coat the top and sides.

After 2 hours of chilling, I was ready to pour the remaining chocolate glaze
over the cake. There's _barely_ enough to do so; next time, I would make more.
If you don't have enough for the sides, the sliced almonds will have nothing
to stick to. Once all the garnishes are applied, the cake needs _another_
3 hours of chilling.

So, was it worth it? Definitely! This dacquoise was a lot of work, and a lot of
waiting, but the first forkful of hazelnut-chocolate-coffee cake was 
a delicious reward for all of that effort. Each slice is beautiful to look at,
and the contrasting textures and flavours make it a sophisticated treat as well.
