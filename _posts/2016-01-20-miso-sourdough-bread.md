As someone who purposefully looks to try new recipes on a constant
basis, I couldn't resist making a bread that featured _miso_ as a
star ingredient. While it may not be a true sourdough, the bread
definitely had a distinctive taste.

The [recipe](http://luckypeach.com/recipes/miso-sourdough-bread/), from
Lucky Peach, calls for _genmai miso_. This is a soybean paste made
from brown rice, but I couldn't find that at any of my usual stores.
I stuck with the plain white (_shiro_) miso that you can find
anywhere.  The dough follows the basic no-knead formula popularized
by Jim Lahey, and requires a 22 hour rest. Following the directions,
I placed the dough in a warm place so that all those bacteria and
yeasts in the miso could do their magic.

I was really pleased with how this turned out. The crust had a 
beautiful, warm colour. There is a definite, funky and salty
flavour to each slice, but you might not recognize it as
miso at first. This is definitely a delicious variation
to standard no-knead bread, one that I'd make again.
