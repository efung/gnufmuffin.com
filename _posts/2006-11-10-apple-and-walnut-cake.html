excerpt: "The recipe in the link says to use self-raising flour, but the book calls for plain (preferably Italian 00) flour. In fact, I think there\'s too much leavener already. 1 &frac12; teaspoons of baking soda is very noticeable; I would reduce it to 1 tsp next time. I also forgot the cream of tartar, maybe"

In fact, I think there's too much leavener already. 1 &frac12; teaspoons of baking soda is very noticeable; I would reduce it to 1 tsp next time. I also forgot the cream of tartar, maybe that would have mellowed things a bit. The walnut oil isn't very detectable, but I made this cake for precisely the same reason Lawson did: I bought the oil to make salad dressing and forgot about it in the fridge. This is a humble cake, with tasty apple and rum-soaked raisins, nothing too special.
