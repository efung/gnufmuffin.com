Earlier this spring, my daughter picked out a chocolate mint plant from 
Sheridan Nurseries. It's grown quite bushy over the summer in its
large pot on our deck, and we decided to use up some of it this
week. Sadly, infusing it in cream did not bring out a lot of its
flavour. The ice cream was still delicious though, especially the
interesting technique of incorporating chocolate.

Max Falkowitz provides the [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-mint-chocolate-chip-ice-cream-recipe)
in Serious Eats. As I mentioned in the intro, the fresh chocolate mint
we used did not produce a "minty" flavour in the custard. I think that's
common to many of the non-peppermint varieties. We ended up adding
a half teaspoon of peppermint extract to the chilled base to correct
the flavour.

The most intriguing thing about the recipe is how it doesn't
actually include chocolate chips. Instead, it uses the
[stracciatella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stracciatella_(ice_cream))
technique of drizzling melted chocolate into the still-churning ice
cream. And, to make the shards and ribbons of chocolate melt more easily
in the mouth, a tiny bit of vegetable oil is added, to lower the 
chocolate's melting point.

Were all these extra steps worth it? Absolutely. This was a mint-chocolate
ice cream (without any added green colouring!) with a pure, clean flavour 
that everyone enjoyed.
