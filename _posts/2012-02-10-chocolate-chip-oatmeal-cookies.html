excerpt: "My wife doesn't like raisins, and most oatmeal cookies you can buy include them. To satisfy a mid-week cookie craving, I whipped up a batch of these Cook's Illustrated cookies. I made sure not to overbake the cookies lest they become dry, but mine were a little smaller than they suggest, as my yield"

To satisfy a mid-week cookie craving, I whipped up a batch of these Cook's Illustrated cookies. I made sure not to overbake the cookies lest they become dry, but mine were a little smaller than they suggest, as my yield was almost two dozen. While they weren't overly hard or dry, I think making the cookies bigger would have resulted in a softer product. Definitely use the old-fashioned oats so that you get the nice chew.
