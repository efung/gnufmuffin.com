The incredible detail and super-composed photography make Luxirare's pages seem like fashion shoots, but we loved the idea of a handheld pie snack and set about to make our own. Using the Cook's Illustrated vodka pie crust, we cut out rounds using a cookie cutter, then placed a paper lollipop stick (available at <a href="http://www.bulkbarnfoods.com/">Bulk Barn</a>) on one round. I cooked an apple pie filling gently on the stove, then Dr. S broke it down with a potato masher. To make the raspberry filling, I cooked some raspberries (that we picked at <a href="http://www.watsonfarms.ca/">Watson Farms</a>with a bit of sugar, liqueur and tapioca starch until it thickened. Using a small cookie scoop, we put teaspoonfuls of filling onto the bottom pie round, then covered it with another piece of dough. We pinched the edges with our fingers, and also crimped it with the tines of a fork for good measure. I baked it at about 375&deg;F until it looked browned. A few things we noticed, and will keep in mind for next time. Some pies leaked a bit of filling so we need to be very careful to seal them tightly. The lollipop sticks tend to slide out unless they are pressed into the bottom of the dough round. And the last thing? We wanted more filling per bite! All in all, it was a very fun experiment, and we surprised a dozen of our friends at a <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/events/gladstone-events/harvest-wednesdays">dinner gathering</a> the next evening with a bonus dessert.
