excerpt: "A very simple sorbet with just three ingredients. Lebovitz\' original recipe calls for Champagne, but I used a Jackson-Triggs sparkling wine. The flavour of this sorbet obviously depends on the quality of your grapefruits. I found the wine flavour to be a little too strong, and would prefer to taste"

The flavour of this sorbet obviously depends on the quality of your grapefruits. I found the wine flavour to be a little too strong, and would prefer to taste more of the grapefruit. But it's still a refreshing sorbet that I would make again for sure.
