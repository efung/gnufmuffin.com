It was tough and seemed stiff. After a rest in the fridge, it puffed up during baking (I didn't prick any holes) even though I used pie weights (dried beans, maybe I need heavier things). The recipe calls for Granny Smith, but I used Spy apples; the fruit needed extra roasting time in the oven for the applesauce. Hand mashing left some chunks, so I pureed the remainder with a hand blender. (By the way, I scaled this recipe up by 25% to account for my larger pan. I probably didn't need to as I had leftover applesauce). For the final baking, the sliced apples didn't caramelize and brown in the oven even with 10 extra minutes. They were also getting dry, so I brushed some apricot glaze on them, then put the pie under the broiler for a few seconds. Perfect! This is a fantastic tart that really highlights the apples. Unfortunately, my crust was too thick and tough, but that didn't stop most people from getting second helpings!
