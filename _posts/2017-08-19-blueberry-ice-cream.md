The Big Giant Basket of Blueberries in the refrigerator remains stubbornly
full. We bought it _last_ week at a Farmer's Market, and have already
made one pie, but there are still many cups to go. Making this ice cream 
only used up a pint, but those two cups sure went a long way.

Continuing my journey through the Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream book, the
headnote mentioned that this ice cream uses extra yolks (eight total) to
balance out the extra water from the blueberries. So it's a little odd
that they call for so much water (â…” cup) when making the compote. I
let my mixture simmer for quite a long time, so that the final volume
was less than 2 cups.

Despite using large, cultivated blueberries, which aren't as intense
as their wild cousins, the flavour is unmistakable. There's just enough
tanginess to balance the creamy, sweet base, and the colour is super
vivid. I look forward to <strike>trying</strike> tasting the sour cream 
blueberry swirl variation in the book for comparison.
