We get weekly deliveries from [Thames River Melons](https://www.thamesrivermelons.com/),
a farm in Ontario offering market boxes this summer, in lieu of
selling at farmers' market stands.  When a heaping flat (6 quarts)
*plus* another 2L basket of local strawberries greets you on your
doorstop, you know that summer is finally here.  Dr. S immediately
asked me to make strawberry shortcakes for dessert, and I was really
excited to find a surprisingly simple way to make them.

To my surprise, the byline on this [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/10/five-ingredient-strawberry-shortcake-scratch-recipe.html) is [J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](https://twitter.com/kenjilopezalt), someone
I associate more with savoury cooking. Anyway, this is probably the
easiest dessert you (or your children) can make. The secret is
making the shortcakes using **self-rising flour and heavy cream**. Period.
That's it. No grating of frozen butter, no rolling and cutting. Just stir,
portion, bake.

I had already made a batch of our favourite [strawberry ice cream](/2014/07/strawberry-ice-cream.html),
so we used that instead. As delicious as this variation was, I think I prefer whipped cream, as I
like how the macerated strawberry juices mingle and stain everything.

Would a more traditional biscuit be flakier, more tender, or more buttery? Probably.
But it wouldn't be this easy to make. Kenji's headnote is accurate: this recipe falls
into the "maximum-return-for-minimum-investment category".
