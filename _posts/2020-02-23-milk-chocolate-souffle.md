Not just a restaurant dessert, a souffle can be a weeknight dessert,
one that's full of protein. Or so I told my kids.

While looking for something to make with milk chocolate, I came across 
this [recipe](https://www.marthastewart.com/1136716/milk-chocolate-souffles).
It says that "Martha" likes using milk chocolate, instead of dark, as it
"gives the dessert a creaminess and flavor that are almost reminiscent of hot chocolate".

Feh. When I tasted this souffle, I kept wanting more chocolate flavour.
My kids liked it, but, eh, there's better souffles out there.
