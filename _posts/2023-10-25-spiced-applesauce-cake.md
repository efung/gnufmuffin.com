Dr. S makes a wonderful pink-hued applesauce after our annual apple 
picking trip. The last jar in the fridge was just enough to make this
snacking cake.

The [recipe](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/10/spiced-applesauce-cake/) 
is from Smitten Kitchen. I picked it because of all the applesauce
cake recipes I found, this one used the most. My logic doesn't have
to make sense all the time.

There's not much to say about this one. It's easy to make, tastes
like what you would expect a spiced applesauce cake to taste like.
