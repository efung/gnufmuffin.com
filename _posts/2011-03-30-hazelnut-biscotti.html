Rummaging around in my freezer produced a bag of hazelnuts. Flipping through <i>Baking With Julia</i>, I spied this biscotti recipe. Perfect! The first step involves skinning the nuts by processing them in a strong alkaline solution. My Dad taught me the same trick to tenderize lotus seeds by using a little baking soda in boiling water. Do use a big pot as the mixture will foam vigorously. Once the skins are slipped off, the nuts go in the oven to dry out and toast.<br /><br />The biscotti are made with no extra fat aside from that in the egg yolks. Shaping the logs was a bit messy, as the dough is sticky and I didn't get as long a log as the recipe advised. I did let the baked logs sit overnight and then did the final toasting the next morning. This was the first time that I tried doing the second bake with the cookies on a rack so that hot air could circulate around them.<br /><br />If you like very crunchy biscotti, this is the recipe for you. They come out dry and crisp but just the right texture for dipping in tea or coffee. I wouldn't chop the nuts so fine in the future though, it's nice to see them whole.
