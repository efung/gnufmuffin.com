I've made a book with Blurb previously and really liked their layout software, BookSmart. All of the images were pulled down from Flickr using BookSmart's built-in support.<br /><br />Each page has a coloured background to indicate the season, as there are two years of photographs in this set. I also made an index which was a challenge because the software doesn't provide any support to do that (or a table of contents). Needless to say, I had to improvise and I will link to a post on the Blurb forums when I write up my experience.
