I love cooked apple desserts -- pie, in particular -- but sometimes, I want to 
make something that's a bit less work. Despite [many apple](/tag/apple/)
experiments over the years, I'm always excited to try new variations.
This Cook's Illustrated
[recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/11908-apple-crumble)
packs four **pounds** of fruit in each batch, and was so good, I
barely got to have any for myself.

The first time I made this was for a potluck, and was far from perfect,
because I didn't read the directions carefully (shakes fist at "divided"
ingredient lists). My first mistake was to forget to add sugar to the 
topping. Shockingly, most people didn't even notice, and thought it was fine.
My second mistake was to use an oblong glass dish, which accommodated the 
double batch, but was specifically called out as contributing to an overly 
mushy filling, due to its heat retention. For allergy reasons, I also
omitted the ground almonds.

A week later, I tried again, making one as written, and one with
low-sugar substitutes. To save time, I roasted the apples ahead of
time, holding them in the fridge overnight. This time around, I
made sure to use square metal pans. Predictably, the one made with
regular Splenda did not caramelize very well. I avoided the brown sugar
Splenda product, as it's actually not a zero-calorie sweetener at
all, and is a 50-50 blend of regular brown sugar and Splenda.

What I like best about this recipe is how much fruit it manages to pack in. The
ratio of fruit to pastry is crucial for a good apple dessert. So many lacklustre
restaurant versions have just a thin, almost jam-like layer underneath the 
biscuit, pie crust, or oatmeal crisp. I will definitely keep making this version,
and selfishly serve myself the first portion.
