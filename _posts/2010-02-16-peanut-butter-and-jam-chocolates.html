Unfortunately, they are a lot more work, as two fillings have to be made and you often have to wait for the first one to set. In this case, the recipe is actually quite simple. I used a magnetic mold lined with strips from three different transfer sheets, and was quite confident that I properly tempered the milk chocolate. The jam layer is made from regular jam (I used strawberry). The other layer is made by adding peanut butter and cocoa butter to melted milk chocolate. After letting it set overnight, I finished the molded chocolates by sealing the filling.<br /><br />While the chocolates were easy to unmold, the surface of the shells told me that my tempering was off yet again. I also found the shells to be too thin, as a gentle nudge on them broke the exterior. As for the taste, these were Dr. S' favourite of the three kinds that I made this week. There's something very simple and nostalgic about PB&amp;J!
