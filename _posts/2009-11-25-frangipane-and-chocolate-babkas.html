The dough is simple to make in a stand mixer, and I left it sit in the fridge for a few days, punching it down when it filled the bowl. Since I made a double batch, I assembled the babkas using two different fillings: the chocolate one and the frangipane one. The former has both cocoa powder as well as chocolate chips, while the latter is made from ground almonds and eggs. Rolling the filled babka was a little tricky because you don't want to stretch the dough too thin, or push the filling away from you. Both these things happened to me, so I wasn't surprised when the filling burst in the oven. Despite this, these babkas were fantastic: a definite tanginess from the yogurt plus extended fermentation time in the fridge, and the contrast of the sweet filling. My favourite would have to be the almond, but my wife declared chocolate to be the winner!
