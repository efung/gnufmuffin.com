excerpt: "A very time-consuming (>6 h) but ultimately satisfying bread. This recipe starts with a sponge, then a long first rise (3 h) then a 2 h proof. Lots of lemon zest, milk, butter and a few eggs make this an enriched dough full of flavour. And the filling, oh the filling: four kinds of nuts, cake crumbs,"

This recipe starts with a sponge, then a long first rise (3 h) then a 2 h proof. Lots of lemon zest, milk, butter and a few eggs make this an enriched dough full of flavour. And the filling, oh the filling: four kinds of nuts, cake crumbs, dried fruit, jam, cocoa, cinnamon and five kinds of liqueurs! To proof and bake, I put the coils in an aluminum charlotte mold and a ceramic souffle dish. Both turned out beautifully, with the ceramic providing a darker crust. Wonderfully tender bread with a delicious swirl of filling. Highly recommended.
