excerpt: "I can\'t remember if I made these with pumpkin or another kind of squash. But from reading several recipes recently, I knew to avoid acorn squash which are stringy and watery. To embellish these muffins, I added chocolate chips to the batter, and walnuts on top. Dr. S loved these and they are indeed"

But from reading several recipes recently, I knew to avoid acorn squash which are stringy and watery. To embellish these muffins, I added chocolate chips to the batter, and walnuts on top. Dr. S loved these and they are indeed a delicious treat for breakfast. They are tender and moist, without the typical &ldquo;pumpkin pie spice&rdquo; flavour. With pumpkins and squash so readily available at the market, I'm going to be looking for other ways to use them in the upcoming weeks.
