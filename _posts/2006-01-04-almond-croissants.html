<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/81759141/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/37/81759141_d04b9805a2_m.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="240" height="180" alt="Almond Croissant (1)" /></a><a href="">Recipe</a> adapted from <span style="font-style: italic;">Baking with Julia</span> by Dorie Greenspan and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Secrets of Baking</span> by Sherry Yard.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Notes</span>: Making croissants is hard. I knew this before embarking on my first attempt so I armed myself with two cookbooks and read various threads on eGullet (<a href="http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=44195">here</a> and <a href="http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=20695">here</a>). A few years ago, I successfully made Danish pastries and after making puff pastry this summer, I felt equipped to tackle these Viennese/French classics. A disappointing specimen at La Maison du Croissant (avoid) in downtown Toronto further motivated me to try making my own.<br /><br />The first problem was the <span style="font-style:italic;">d√©trempe</span> from <span style="font-style:italic;">Baking with Julia</span>. It was dry and stiff and resisted all attempts at rolling to the point that I gave up and threw it out. I noticed that its recipe had no butter, so I switched to using the recipe from Yard's book. Since the <span style="font-style:italic;">beurrage</span> was already made (using <a href="http://www.lactantia.ca/products/butter.htm">Lactantia</a> Unsalted Cultured Butter), I sliced a chunk out of it to make the <span style="font-style:italic;">Secrets</span> croissant dough. Ah, much better, smooth and easy to work with. I gave it a leisurely 24 hour rest in the fridge and resumed the next evening. Despite my determined efforts, the initial shape of the dough wasn't quite square which made <a title="using a blintz fold, like in origami">enclosing</a> the butter block a little challenging. The turns went well and I let it rest 60-90 minutes in-between, a compromise between Yard's 30 minutes and Greenspan's 2 hours.<br /><br />Early this morning, I tried rolling out the dough to the prescribed 18&times;20 inches. Unfortunately, the outer layer of dough began to split and butter started peeking through. I had to cut short the rolling at around 16&times;18 inches. My rolling pin is a French one with <a title"better to use one with handles for a more even roll">tapered</a> ends, and my counter space is limited, not the best environment for this kind of work. I shaped using a combination of instructions from the two sets of directions (from Yard: making a small cut on the short side to help give it the crescent shape; from Greenspan, stretching the triangles first to get more length). The croissants didn't have enough rolls as the pastry wasn't thin enough. In the centre of each one, I inserted a tiny piece of marzipan. Proofing took about 2 hours. I applied an egg wash then sprinkled toasted sliced almonds on top.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/81759162/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/81759162_f181e9d4e6_m.jpg" class="inlineright" width="240" height="180" alt="Almond Croissant (2)" /></a>As expected, the butter leaked out during baking and formed a puddle underneath the pastries. I needed 30 minutes in total for the croissants to get golden brown. And my apartment was perfumed with the aroma of butter. After resting (and draining) on paper towels while I was at work, the croissants were ready to be sampled when I got home. Definitely flakey and buttery, with crisp distinct layers. A little too much salt though, and I could have used more marzipan in the interior. Maybe some almond extract in the dough too! I can't wait for next time, after I buy some new pants.
