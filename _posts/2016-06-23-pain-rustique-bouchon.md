Over the past two weeks, I've built up a _liquid levain_ (wet sourdough starter)
[again](/2015/05/walnut-batards.html) and went back to the bread recipes in
[Bouchon Bakery](/tag/bouchon-bakery/). The first few loaves I made with this 
starter were a rustic white bread that had great chew, and a mild sour flavour.

I fed the starter twice daily for about a week, experimenting with various 
locations in my house: in the oven with the incandescent lamp on, a high
shelf on the warm, third floor, and on the kitchen counter. The
starter was quite active with bubbles, and by the end of the first week,
I started adjusting the temperature and water level to develop a more
sour flavour.

From the Bouchon book, they suggest increasing the temperature and
decreasing the water. There were also a lot of tips from this
[article in Brød &
Taylor](http://brodandtaylor.com/make-sourdough-more-sour/), mainly,
fermenting at a warmer temperature (up to 29°C) and using some rye
flour. These are things I will have to try in a few weeks.

The recipe begins with a long stand mixer knead of 20 minutes, as
with the other breads in the book. The process of patting, stretching,
and folding the dough directly affects the structure, as I discovered
after making two loaves. Too much patting deflates the bubbles and
the resulting bread has a finer texture, instead of an open, airy crumb.

I experimented with letting the dough proof on a linen, as well as in
a rice-flour coated banneton. I prefer the former, as it yields smaller
slices, but both ways turned out fine.

Overall, this was a promising start to my sourdough experiments for the summer.
However, I need to work on my steam generation, as the baked loaves turned out
a bit pale, without the deeper golden colour shown in the book's photographs.
The recipe appears alongside the _Pain Palladin_ which has a slightly different
proportion of flour, levain and yeast, so that's one I'll have to try for
comparison purposes.
