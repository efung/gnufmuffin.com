My go-to [strawberry ice cream](/2014/07/strawberry-ice-cream.html) is really good: it's
made with a classic custard base, with lots of strawberry flavour. But it's a pain
to make (even though I make it every year when we have good berries). After trying
what Serious Eats calls "The Best" version of strawberry ice cream, I'm pleased
to report that their eggless, no-cook version is 90% as good, but with _way_ less
effort.

This [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/best-strawberry-ice-cream-recipe.html)
uses a "Philadelphia"-style base, one that doesn't use any egg yolks for richness. And
without any heating (to cook the yolks, or to break down the strawberries), it leaves your
kitchen much cooler, and makes the ice cream taste brighter.

I stuck with the recipe pretty closely, but did use a mix of heavy cream and 2% milk (around 1 
part cream, 2 parts milk) in place of the confusingly named half-and-half. The resulting ice cream was
incredibly fragrant, with a noticably bright strawberry flavour. I **highly recommend** this 
recipe. It didn't have a rich mouthfeel, but I don't think I miss it too much. It's a tradeoff 
I'm willing to make, to avoid having to figure out what to do with leftover [egg whites](/tag/eggwhites/).
