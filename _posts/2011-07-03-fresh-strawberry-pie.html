They are so plentiful in the markets and roadside stands at this time of year. And the prices for a flat are so much cheaper than in Ontario. I wanted to showcase these berries in a pure fruit pie, and found this recent Cook's Illustrated recipe.<br /><br />I made a total of four pies over two days. It's been a while since I made the CI vodka pie crust, so I messed up the first two: I didn't process the dough long enough for it to form big clumps. Instead, I mixed in the remaining flour while it was still crumb-like. This resulted in a cracker-like finished product.<br /><br />The time-consuming steps in this recipe are in making the quick strawberry jam, because you need to puree the berries and cook them over a stove. But I think the effort is worth it: every bite of the pie delivers pure strawberry flavour. The filling isn't thick and gummy, as is the case with most store-bought strawberry pies.&nbsp;One of the key ingredients, low-sugar pectin, was not available to me, so I tried substituting unflavoured gelatin to make the glaze.&nbsp;I don't think gelatin is the right substitute for pectin here (or maybe I didn't use enough). But I do agree with CI's founder in that a pie filling should be a little juicy.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for this pie!
