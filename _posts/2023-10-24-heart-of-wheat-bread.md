Sometimes I think about why I make bread, when I live in a big
city with many good bakeries. My bread isn't better than what I
can buy, and it certainly takes more effort. I don't find it
relaxing to knead (and I use a machine to do that anyway). Hmm.

I spotted this recipe in Rose Levy Beranbaum's _The Bread
Bible_. She calls it the culmination of everything she learned 
about bread baking while writing the book. After making a sponge
and letting it rest for 4 hours, you proceed with adding the
rest of the flour, kneading, proofing, etc. So this is 
a recipe that you have to plan ahead for.

I wasn't that thrilled with it. It had a nice flavour, and made decent
toast, but wasn't that memorable. I'll make it again though, as
I have a lot of wheat germ left!
