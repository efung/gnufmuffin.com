My brother-in-law, who is staying with us for a while, really,
<i>really</i> wanted banana bread. I happened to be cooking out of
one of Ottolenghi's savory cookbooks, when I saw this recipe in the last chapter. 

The
[recipe](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~gkilvington/recipes/banana_bread.html)
comes from [Plenty
More](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/13/plenty-more-yotam-ottolenghi-book-review)
by Yotam Ottolenghi. Like many other vegetarians (and meatatarians
alike), my wife and I have become devoted fans, cooking and serving
recipes from his four cookbooks. Although Ottolenghi got his start as a
pastry chef, I've never really thought much of the sweets he's included
in the books.

This banana bread starts off with a simple quick bread, loaded with
2 cups of toasted pecans. Compared to other banana breads, in my humble
opinion, it's a little too dense, and a little too mild in flavour.
However, the recipe doesn't stop there. It continues with the
instruction to spread thick slices generously with butter.

These went into the toaster oven to brown a bit (despite the recipe
including the word “grilled”, I would describe this as “broiled” or
“toasted”). When the slices come out, I drizzled them with tahini.

The final step is to lay a piece of honeycomb on top, and sprinkle the
whole plate with a little sea salt. (Amusing story: my wife went to
[Longo's](http://www.longos.com/) for groceries, and
the employee she talked to kept insisting she meant the
[cereal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_%28cereal%29). When she
told them she meant what honeybees produce, she said “Oh, no one's ever
asked for that before.”)

Mmmmm. That's all we had to say as we ate this after the kids went to bed. 
The tahini and honeycome really elevate a mediocre banana bread into
something much more delicious.
