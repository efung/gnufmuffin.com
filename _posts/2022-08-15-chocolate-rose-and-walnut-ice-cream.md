It's a bit late in the summer, but I'm starting to ramp up ice cream production 
at our house. All of the summer fruit is now widely available, so there are so
many choices. However, I do enjoy a chocolate-based frozen treat every now
and then, so I mixed things up with this ice cream from [Sweet](/tag/sweet-ottolenghi/).

This [recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/27/ice-cream-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi)
from the Guardian is not quite the same as the one in the book. They differ
slightly in the amount of rosewater, and the use of digestive biscuits as a mix-in. Anyway,
the one notable thing about the recipe is that it calls for "cooking out" the cocoa powder
in the hot cream. Aside from that, the custard is just a standard chocolate ice cream base.

Just before churning though, you're supposed to add up to 1 tbsp of rosewater.
Mine wasn't very strong (it was Cedar brand) even after using the full amount; maybe
it's my dulled, post-COVID tongue…

I skipped the chocolate sauce and Turkish delight, but did sprinkle the finished
ice cream with dried rose petals. This was a fun twist on chocolate ice cream:
bitter and sweet, bits of toasted nut, and a hint of… something. I'll have to
find a stronger rose water next time I'm at the Middle Eastern grocery.
