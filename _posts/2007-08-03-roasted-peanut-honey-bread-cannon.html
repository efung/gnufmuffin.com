excerpt: "The dough for this bread is quite heavy and sticky so I\'m glad I used the mixer to knead it. I tried to use a minimal amount of flour, and after about 10 minutes on #2 speed, the dough cleared the sides of the bowl but was still quite tacky. The bread has a nice peanut-wheat taste, but the chopped peanuts"

Cannon via epicurious.com<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Notes</span>: The dough for this bread is quite heavy and sticky so I'm glad I used the mixer to knead it. I tried to use a minimal amount of flour, and after about 10 minutes on #2 speed, the dough cleared the sides of the bowl but was still quite tacky. The bread has a nice peanut-wheat taste, but the chopped peanuts are a little soft. An interesting loaf (which I only made to use up some peanut butter and roasted peanuts).
