excerpt: "I got a deal at the farmer's market on four pints of raspberries, nearly the last of the season. This pie crust gave me a bit of trouble as it cracked a lot during rolling, but I kneaded the top crust a bit more and it held together much better. For the liqueur, I used Southbrook Winery's Framboise."

This pie crust gave me a bit of trouble as it cracked a lot during rolling, but I kneaded the top crust a bit more and it held together much better. For the liqueur, I used <a href="http://www.southbrook.com/home.htm">Southbrook Winery</a>'s Framboise. What a great pie, brimming with berry flavour and the raw cane sugar on the top made a crunchy, sweet topping.
