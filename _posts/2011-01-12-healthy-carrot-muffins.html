excerpt: "Dr. S wanted some healthy muffins and I rummaged around on the Web to find one that might use up some ingredients in the fridge. Since I was out of wheat bran, I limited myself to ones using oat bran or something like that. This carrot muffin looked good but I didn't have pineapple: time to find a substitute!"

Since I was out of wheat bran, I limited myself to ones using oat bran or something like that. This carrot muffin looked good but I didn't have pineapple: time to find a substitute! What about a can of lychees? They turned out pretty good: very moist with an unusual tropical flavour.
