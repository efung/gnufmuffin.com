I enjoy eating things with raisins in them. And dried fruit too. Oh,
and cinnamon. There I said it. I'm one of those people that like 
things like [spumoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spumoni) and
[fruitcake](/tag/fruitcake/). Unfortunately, I've been unable to
convince anyone in my family to enjoy these things. That didn't stop 
me from making a wonderful panettone, the sweet Italian bread, 
full of vanilla and citrus flavours. And raisins!

The [recipe](http://joepastry.com/2011/panettone-recipe/) came from 
one of Peter Reinhart's books, known as "BBA" to bakers online. My 
first attempt at this recipe was a failure: I didn't use a refreshed 
bread starter, nor did I proof the dough at a warm enough temperature.
Lastly, I split the dough between an 8" pan as well as some mini baking 
papers. The result of all these blunders was a dense, dry product, that
had an unpleasant chewy texture.

To make this bread during the week, I started with the sponge after dinner.
I used a refreshed _liquid levain_ I've been maintaining as the "bread starter".
I don't think it's too important what hydration your starter is, as you'll adjust
it in the final dough anyway. I made the dried fruit mixture too, using whiskey,
raisins, candied lemon peel, and a blend of vanilla, lemon extract and orange oil.

The next evening, during dinner, I made the final dough in a stand mixer.
Reinhart's instructions note a desired temperature of 24 to 27ºC (75
to 80ºF), which I discovered I wasn't reaching by leaving the dough
on the counter. To remedy this, I put the dough (covered in plastic)
in my oven, turned it on for a few minutes, and then left the light on.

To shape, I put the whole batch of dough in my 8" panettone pan. It crested
well above the rim by the time it was put in the oven. This time, my loaf came
out beautifully: pillowy and light, with an incredible aroma. Each slice was
full of dried fruit, and was sweet enough for a snack on its own. 

Reinhart's formulas for panettone are winners, both this one, and the
[whole wheat one](/2013/03/whole-wheat-panettone.html) I made a few
years ago!
