excerpt: "Mom and I made some gingerbread from a recipe that she had used in previous years. The dough was easy to work with, but it was difficult to gauge how thick to roll them. Seeing that they didn't spread very much in the oven, we packed them in pretty tightly. Unfortunately, the cookies were quite hard,"

The dough was easy to work with, but it was difficult to gauge how thick to roll them. Seeing that they didn't spread very much in the oven, we packed them in pretty tightly. Unfortunately, the cookies were quite hard, which, after reading the entry about gingerbread in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dessert Bible</span>, is a common problem with most cookie recipes. They are excellent for shaping but not so much for eating. I placed some gingerbread in a Tupperware with a small slice of apple for a week and that softened them up considerably. I'm going to have some with a nice cup of chai!
