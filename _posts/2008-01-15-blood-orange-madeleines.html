Start to finish: about 2 hours. This isn't a traditional madeleine recipe as it uses baking powder and doesn't require chilling of the batter. The citrus flavour comes from simmered, pureed blood orange (the entire fruit: zest, pith and flesh). They rose quite nicely but didn't develop a lot of colour, maybe a few extra minutes in the oven would have been okay. I dipped them in melted chocolate chips. These are quite delicious, combining sweet, tangy and bitter flavours together in a cake-like cookie.
