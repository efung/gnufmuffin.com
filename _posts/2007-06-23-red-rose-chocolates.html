excerpt: "Continuing my freezer purge, I had a tiny bit of strained raspberry puree so I tried making another chocolate from this book. The flavour is predominantly raspberry, but the rosewater was too subtle. I used at least 5 drops, but would add even more next time. The raspberry visibly coloured the ganache."

The flavour is predominantly raspberry, but the rosewater was too subtle. I used at least 5 drops, but would add even more next time. The raspberry visibly coloured the ganache. As an experiment, I tried placing a small piece of a transfer sheet on the bottom of my molds. The key is to ensure the piece lies flat to avoid an air pocket. I was quite pleased with how these turned out, the tempering seems to be much better than past attempts. I no longer cool the chocolate in the refrigerator, and really tried to eliminate bubbles by tapping vigorously. The mold is model <a href="http://www.chocolatform.com/index.php?pag=products&pid=44">CF0402</a> by the Italian company Chocolat Form which I bought from Design &amp; Realisation.
