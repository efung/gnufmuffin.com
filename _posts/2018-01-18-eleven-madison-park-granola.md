Near my office is a small "plant-based" restaurant that has a very
delicious breakfast called a blue smoothie bowl. It's topped with
fresh fruit, seeds, and granola. While trying to recreate it at home,
I came across this granola that I hadn't made before.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014304-eleven-madison-park-granola)
was published in the New York Times, and is pretty standard. Combine all the ingredients
together (except the dried fruit, which would dry out in the oven), coat them
with a fat and liquid sugar mix, then slowly toast and dry out the mixture.

I loved the buttery pistachios and the texture of the coconut flakes. Despite using
soft dried cherries, after a week or so, they lost their moisture and became
dry and chewy. The amount of salt used is definitely noticeable, but it's
a welcome change from the usually cloying store-bought blends.

As for recreating my restaurant favourite, I think I've nailed the
granola and other toppings, but I'm still tinkering with the bowl
itself.
