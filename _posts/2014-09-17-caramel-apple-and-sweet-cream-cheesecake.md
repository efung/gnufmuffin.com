Despite not making a lot of [cheesecakes](/tag/cheesecake), I really
enjoy them at special occasions (or any other time, I suppose). 
With fall weather approaching, I dug up a recipe from one of my favourite 
baking books, and made caramel apple cheesecake this week.

[Regan Daley](http://www.regandaley.com/)'s [In The Sweet Kitchen](/tag/In%20The%20Sweet%20Kitchen)
is one of my favourite baking guides; her flavours, combinations and
creativity appeal to me. Her recipe for this cheesecake required two
things I didn't have on hand: oatmeal cookies and dried apple rings.

At a grocer near my office, I picked up [Highland
Oatcakes](http://www.walkersshortbread.com/uk/oatcakes/box-highland-oatcakes-300g/). 
They're marketed for serving with cheese, and have much less sugar and 
fat than any of the available cookies. The cheesecake recipe includes the 
usual suspects, plus heavy cream and Calvados. I substituted Apfelkorn,
but wonder if buying a bottle of the French spirit would be worth it:
it's twice as expensive, but has twice the alcohol too, meaning its
flavour might be more prominent. True to the recipe's description,
the cake finished baking with a smooth top, without cracking. 

It took a few more days before I could acquire the other missing
ingredient. A bulk store would have been the obvious choice, but none were
located conveniently along my daily commute. I ended up scouring the
aisles of a Loblaws three times before finding a package of dried
apple rings.

The caramel sauce is where most of the apple flavour in this cheesecake
comes from. Adding the dried rings is a clever way to add a concentrated
dose of fruit flavour, without watering down the sauce. To give a nicer
presentation, I used kitchen shears to cut the fruit up into smaller 
pieces. The sauce yield wasn't enough for me, and I would make 
a double batch the next time.

Overall, this is quite a delicious cheesecake, with its warm,
slightly tart sauce providing a nice complement to the
subtly flavoured cake. I would definitely make it again.
