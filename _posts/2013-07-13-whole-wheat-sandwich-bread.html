But it is also enriched with milk, honey, butter and oil. No wonder it tastes so delicious! A full two tablespoons of yeast ensures that the bread isn't dense, and an overnight biga and grain soaker provide lots of complex, wheaty flavour. The dough is quite soft and a bit sticky, but the kneading step after the first rise only involves stretching and folding. Check out the photos after baking: lots of oven spring! I don't know whether I would make this on a regular basis: it's a heavily enriched dough, and I prefer my breakfast toast to be a bit more neutral.
