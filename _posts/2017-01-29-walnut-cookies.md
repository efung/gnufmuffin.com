For Chinese New Year celebrations this year, my family didn't coordinate who would bring what
to the potluck. To cover savory and sweet, we made [_dan dan mian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandan_noodles),
chocolate oatmeal cookies, and these walnut cookies.

The [recipe](https://puredeliciousness.blogspot.ca/2009/09/pichet-ongs-chinese-walnut-cookies.html) is
very simple. I was surprised that the walnuts aren't ground and incorporated into the dough. Instead,
a portion of them are broken up while creaming the butter and sugars, and the remaining ones are just pressed
onto the top as a garnish.

These cookies spread significantly due to their high ratio of butter, and needed at least 15 minutes baking 
time before they set. I was expecting a walnut version of 
[Chinese almond cookies](/2008/02/chinese-almond-cookies.html) but these were just delicate, buttery crisps.
