We stopped at a few wineries, including <a href="http://www.daniellenko.com/">Daniel Lenko Estate Winery</a> where we tasted vintages in the Lenko home kitchen. Somewhere east of the Lenko vineyard, we stopped at a roadside stand and bought some stone fruit, including a big basket of Fantasia nectarines. It turns out these are the most common variety in Niagara. They were a tad underripe, making them crunchy, yet sweet. Returning home, we decided to make some preserves over the next few days. One recipe we tried used just fruit, sugar and lemon juice, so was very easy to prepare. The fruit rose to the top, floating in a beautiful rosy coloured liquid. We can't wait to try these later in the winter. I'll update with more notes when we open a jar.
