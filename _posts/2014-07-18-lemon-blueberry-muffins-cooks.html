excerpt: "We found ourselves with about 2.5kg of yogurt recently, so I set out to use some of it up in a muffin. I followed this recipe closely, but made one change: to ensure tenderness, I swapped about a cup of the AP flour with cake flour. The batter completely filled the cups of a large tin, and produced muffins"

I followed this recipe closely, but made one change: to ensure tenderness, I swapped about a cup of the AP flour with cake flour. The batter completely filled the cups of a large tin, and produced muffins with big caps. Flavour-wise, these weren't particularly memorable. I'll stick with my tried and true <a href="/2006/04/lemon-blueberry-muffins.html">favourite</a>.
