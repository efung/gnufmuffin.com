I've really embraced the custom of eating fried foods to celebrate
[Hanukkah](/tag/hanukkah/). A few weeks ago, we started planning
a menu for a party we would be hosting. Of course, doughnuts 
needed to be on that menu, and I chose one of the recipes
from [Bouchon Bakery](/tag/bouchon-bakery/) to make.

<span class="highlight">**Errata note**: The
 [recipe](http://familymealblog.com/2013/02/15/cherry-cream-doughnuts-not-everything-has-to-be-perfect/) 
in some editions of the book, as well as in the copy I
linked to, contain an error in the measurement of the butter. 
One batch of doughnut dough should have **57 grams** of butter, not 5
grams.</span>

To feed our crowd, I decided it would be best to make two batches.
I wondered whether I would be able to do it on session, since the
dough needs to be kneaded in a mixer for **30 minutes**. Despite
the instructions, my dough wasn't sticky at all, and easily
cleared the bowl and became quite stiff. The mixer itself got
really hot, so I made one batch in the morning, and another
in the evening. Make sure your butter is soft, and don't
try to quickly soften it in the microwave unless you're really careful.
Butter won't incorporate nicely into the stiff dough if it's partially
melted.

After folding, resting and chilling the dough, I rolled it out and cut
it into discs. The standard yield for the recipe is ten, 3-inch
doughnuts, but we decided to use 2-inch cutters for a more manageable
snack. Following the instructions on freezing unbaked brioche pastries,
I froze the individual pucks on a sheet pan, then put them in a freezer
bag once they were hard.

A few days later, on the morning of the party, I took out the frozen
doughnuts, spacing them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and covered
them with plastic wrap to let them slowly proof. This took about 4
hours.

In a Dutch oven filled with about 2 inches of canola oil, I heated it
until the temperature was a steady 335Â°F. Not all of the doughnuts
were perfectly cylindrical: as they expanded in the hot oil, one
side would rise more than the other. I used tongs to flip the fried
dough so that it would brown evenly.

Once all the doughnuts were cooked, I set them outside briefly to cool
completely, before my helpers filled them with cherry jam. Using
the piping bag was messy, as we pureed a jar of cherry preserves
causing the filling to be very runny. It was also difficult to create a
large enough cavity to pipe enough jam inside. In the end, the best
technique was to poke a hole in the _top_ of the doughnut, so that
gravity would keep the jam from spilling out (thanks Steph!).

The verdict? I found these doughnuts to be way too dense. The brioche
base should have made for a very soft doughnut. Maybe the smaller size
meant I should have fried them for a shorter duration, or maybe
the gluten was over-developed. In any case, fried dough is still
enjoyable, slathered with whipped cream and extra jam. Leftovers
were much better if you microwaved them for a little bit.
