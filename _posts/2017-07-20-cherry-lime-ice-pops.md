Sometimes, an idea that sounds good in print doesn't taste good when it's
made. Such was the case with these cherry ice pops.

I followed a basic
[recipe](http://www.skinnytaste.com/cherry-lime-ice-pops/) I found online,
and replaced the sugar and water with some store-bought lemonade. The
total amount of sugar would be quite little, I recognized, and I
think that's what contributed to the crumbly, unpleasant texture of these
ice pops. Taste-wise, my wife said they resembled cough syrup, which,
I guess, says something about synthetic cherry flavourings.
