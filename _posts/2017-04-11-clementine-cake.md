Night two of Passover meant a second dessert, and after enjoying many delicious
Jaffa Orri mandarins over the weekend, I knew exactly what I wanted to make. 
This clementine cake covered in chocolate frosting was a wonderful finish to a 
big holiday meal.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016184-clementine-cake) is 
from the New York Times, but an almost identical 
[recipe](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/clementine-cake)
appears in Nigella Lawson's _Hot To Eat_ from almost 20 years ago. In any case,
the first step is to simmer the fruit in water for two hours until they're soft, 
a step that I performed the night before. Without access to a scale, I decided 
to play it safe and use 6 mandarins.

To make the cake, I cut open the softened fruit, plucked out the seeds, then
used a food processor to produce a smooth paste. Then, it was just mixing
the rest of the ingredients together. As a Passover consideration, I omitted
the baking powder (but, you may include it if you agree with 
[this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/dining/05leav.html)). The 
cake was deeply browned after the one hour mark.

Once it was cool, I turned the cake onto a rack, then made the 
[chocolate glaze](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016259-chocolate-glaze).
In case any of our guests cared, I made it _pareve_ by substituting Earth Balance 
shortening for the butter, and used maple syrup instead of corn syrup. I started
by partially melting the chocolate in the microwave, then adding the shortening.
To hasten cooling, I immersed the warm bowl in an ice bath, but neglected to
scrape the bottom regularly, leading to a lumpy mixture. A few seconds in 
the microwave melted out the lumps and made the glaze smooth again.

A few hours at a cool room temperature was enough to set the frosting. The slices
were easy to cut, and the interior was moist and fragrant. The only criticisms I
have are easily remedied: the cake was a bit too wet (since I didn't weigh the fruit)
and the glaze was too salty (since I used a shortening meant for spreading on bread).
I would make this again, any time of year.
