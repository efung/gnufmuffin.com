A few weeks ago, Flick saw someone on Facebook mention a
&ldquo;Chinese challah&rdquo;. The cynic in me immediately scoffed
and wondered aloud what would make it Chinese: Soy sauce? [Lap
cheong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_sausage)? Sesame?
For this week's Shabbat, instead of buying a loaf at the grocer near my
office, I decided to investigate this idea.

It didn't take long to turn up Molly Yeh's [blog
post](http://mynameisyeh.com/mynameisyeh/2014/1/scallion-pancake-challah)
describing a Scallion Pancake Challah. If you're not familiar with
this savoury treat, it's a flat, flaky, fried dough containing lots of
green onions. Wikipedia has an entry under [cong you
bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cong_you_bing). The cooking
techniques vary: [one
recipe](http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/blogs/editor/2013/10/hugh-acheson-scallion-pancakes.html)
instructs you to fry the minced scallions and add lard to the dough,
[another
one](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Classic-Scallion-Pancakes) uses
cold water and a coiling technique to laminate the dough, while
[this
one](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/extra-flaky-scallion-pancakes-recipe.html)
uses a boiling water dough.

Yeh's inspiration for the idea was her own Jewish-Asian background. Come
to think of it, when we were in Shanghai, I tried a scallion pancake
from a [street
vendor](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6293838730/in/set-72157627740935959)
near the metro station closest fo the Jewish Refugees Museum. It was so
tasty and cheap (a few RMB), I immediately ordered another one.

Her
[recipe](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/blog/jewish-and/2014/01/21/challah-with-a-chinese-twist/)
doesn't incorporate any of the scallion pancake's techniques to
produce flakiness, just the ingredients. I started the recipe on
Thursday evening intending to finish the challah before bedtime,
but fell asleep during the first rise. Flick punched down the dough
and put it in the fridge. The next morning, it had risen enough to
lift the lid off the bowl. I weighed out three equal pieces, rolled
them into fat ropes, then flattened each one. 

After brushing each length with sesame oil, I sprinkled scallions,
chili flakes, black pepper and salt over each one. From my experience
with making filled challahs, I knew that overfilling or wetting the
edges would prevent each log from sealing. Indeed, I had trouble
pinching the sides closed due to the oil. Grabbing the outside of
the dough, and pulling it around the open edge helped somewhat.

The prescribed baking time of 25 minutes wasn't enough to brown my loaf,
so I left it in for an additional 20 minutes. Despite not browning the
scallions beforehand, the smell of this bread while it's baking was
amazing. My finished challah looked very much like the one on Molly's
blog, expanding sideways rather than upwards. I attribute the density 
and lacklustre flavour of the loaf to the poor underlying challah 
recipe (only 2 eggs, and a single rise). Using a different base challah
dough, I'm sure I could make a tastier version.

As we tore into it during Shabbat, I wasn't exactly reminded of
a scallion pancake. But we all enjoyed this interesting variation and
I'd like to try it again this Friday. The only downside to a savoury
challah is that you can't use it to make French toast on Saturday
morning!
