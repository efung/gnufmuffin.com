This <a href="http://gnufmuffin.blogspot.com/2008/06/apple-confit-with-miso-ice-cream.html">isn't the first time</a> I've used miso in baking or dessert but it's definitely my first cookie using the paste. My only substitution was using regular brown sugar instead of dark. I also chilled the entire batch of dough overnight before baking. I used convection at 315&deg;F and took the cookies out at the 11 minute mark. They were underbaked, but cooled to a nice, soft consistency. None of my four different tasters could detect what was in them. They're not overly salty, but lack a strong peanut flavour.
