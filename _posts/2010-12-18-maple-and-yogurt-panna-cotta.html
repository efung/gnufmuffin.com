But that was too ambitious for a weeknight project, so I ended up making this maple-yogurt one instead. The use of yogurt tempers the richness and sweetness of cream and maple syrup and was a welcome addition. I used maple syrup from a tin I bought in Montreal this summer: it was dark and flavourful and was really noticeable in the panna cotta. This was a pretty easy dessert to make, even though everyone at dinner thought it was fancy.
