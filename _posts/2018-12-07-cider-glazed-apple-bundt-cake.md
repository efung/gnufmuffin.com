Cider is the grown-up version of apple juice. I like it in its pure, unadulterated, 
cold-pressed form, or in its boozy, hard rendition. So when I came across this
[Cook's Illustrated](/tag/cook-s-illustrated/) cake calling for **one quart** of
cider, I was intrigued. How was this much liquid going to get incorporated?

It turns out the [recipe](http://www.frasertan.com/cider-glazed-apple-bundt-cake.html)
uses two key ideas for making the most apple-y cake ever. First, cider isn't concentrated
enough to impart enough flavour, so you boil it down into a syrup. (If you happen
to live in the New England, USA area, you might be lucky enough to find 
ready-to-use [boiled cider](https://www.slowfoodusa.org/ark-item/boiled-cider-and-cider-jelly-of-new-england) 
in farm stores.) Second, apple chunks leave pockets of moist pockets in the dough, so
it's better to grate the apples to impart both moisture and flavour more evenly.

Finally, after the cake is baked, there's a final one-two finish to drive home the
point that this is an apple cake: an all-over brushing with boiled cider, followed 
by a glaze made from icing sugar and, you guessed it, more of that sweet apple syrup.

I thought this cake was fantastic. I made it on a Friday, then left it under a cake dome at 
room temperature until our party on Sunday. The glaze had dissolved into the cake a bit,
making the outside a bit gooey. Every bite was full of apple flavour, with a pleasing
tartness, rather than the cloying flavour of some apple coffee cakes with their sugary
streusel. Even after a few more days under the dome, pieces of the sliced cake stayed 
moist. Highly recommended.
