Cheese and caramel popcorn. Hamburgers and milkshakes. 
Chocolate-covered potato chips. These are all things **I don't like**.
However, what they have in common is the sweet and salty combination.
I really wanted to like this new (to me) banana bread recipe, but
I think I messed up in the execution.

Bryan Washington wrote a [nice piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/magazine/miso-pecan-banana-bread-recipe.html) 
about banana bread in the New York Times Magazine recently. His
[recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023832-miso-pecan-banana-bread) is notable because of the inclusion of miso, its salty complexity
complementing the sweetness of banana.

Unfortunately, mine turned out a little dense and gummy on the bottom.
I also didn't taste the miso very much. I did love the salted pecan
topping though. And, as other reviewers have noted, the use of cinnamon
**and** nutmeg overpowers the miso. I'll try making this again though,
as I really want to love this idea.
