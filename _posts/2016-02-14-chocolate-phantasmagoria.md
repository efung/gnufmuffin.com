There's no sweet ingredient more beloved by my wife than
[chocolate](/tag/chocolate/). So, naturally, I knew a chocolate
cake would make her (Valentine's) day. I pulled out one of
[Marcel Desaulniers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Desaulniers)'
books, [Death By Chocolate](/tag/death-by-chocolate/) and found
just the right dessert.

As is the case in many of his cake books, the
[recipe](http://www.mrscake.co.nz/2011/07/chocolate-phantasmagoria.html)
is ridiculously titled. In case you didn't know (as I didn't), a
[phantasmagoria](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/phantasmagoria) is
_"a fantastic sequence of haphazardly associative imagery, as seen in
dreams or fever"_. What kind of name is that for a dessert!?

I started by making the hazelnut butter, which was literally hazelnuts +
butter. Toasting and skinning the nuts was the time-consuming part. The
finished mixture tasted like hazelnuts, but not that enticing, as it
lacked sugar and oil, and it's definitely not the same as hazelnut
paste, which is made from praline.

There's not much to say about the cake, other than to note that
it includes both cocoa and unsweetened chocolate, as well as
using boiling water. My layers weren't of even thickness, as I
I tried to slice the baked cake on a cutting board, instead 
of on a turntable.

Assembly was a breeze, and my only tip is to ensure the nut butter
and ganache are soft enough to spread easily. Make judicious use
of a microwave or double-boiler as necessary. If the fillings are
too stiff, you'll risk tearing the cake as you frost them.

My wife noted that the cake was a bit dense and dry. I also found it
to be undersweetened. Hazelnut and chocolate is a classic flavour 
combination (who doesn't like Nutella?) but I feel a slice of this
cake needs to be accompanied by a hot, sweetened beverage, like a 
caf√© au lait or a milk tea.
