excerpt: "Instead of a berry fool I had intended to make, I took the raspberries I bought and made all three puddings from the recipes in this cookbook. One important note about these recipes is that they don't yield the same volume, so if you're trying to make a layered pudding like I did, you'll have to make"

One important note about these recipes is that they don't yield the same volume, so if you're trying to make a layered pudding like I did, you'll have to make some adjustments. The green tea recipe employs the same amount of heavy cream, but the raspberry and chocolate ones have added ingredients (raspberries and chocolate, respectively) that increase the amount of pudding made. To compensate, I would make 1.5&times; the green tea recipe. Acting on a <a href="http://pghtasted.blogspot.com/2008/01/green-tea-pudding.html">tip</a>, I cut the green tea powder back to 1.5 tbsp. One other change I made was to strain the cooked raspberries (it's clear from the photograph that they do this). Overall the puddings are very tasty, each with a distinct and assertive flavour, and the layering makes for an attractive presentation.
