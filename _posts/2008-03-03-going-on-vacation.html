I won't be doing any baking for awhile... I'm currently in the San Francisco Bay Area for work, then will be off to South Africa for vacation. By Saturday, I'll have been in four different countries! Look for updates in my <a href="http://gnuf-travels.blogspot.com/">travel journal</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/gnuf/">Flickr photostream</a>.
