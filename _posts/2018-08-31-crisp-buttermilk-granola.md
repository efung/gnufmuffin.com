Browsing through my Twitter [food list](https://twitter.com/gnufmuffin/lists/food), 
the first post to pop up was a _crispy_ granola recipe. That was enough to catch my 
eye, but opening the article hooked me even further: soaking the rolled oats in 
buttermilk!

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/06/crispy-homemade-granola-recipe.html)
is by [Stella Parks](https://twitter.com/gnufmuffin/lists/food) and it's a keeper.
The granola did indeed turn out very crispy and very addictive.

For my batch, I followed her instructions pretty closely, swapping dried mangoes
for apricots, sunflower seeds for pumpkin, and omitting the dried blueberries because 
I didn't have any. Obviously, you can use whatever you like, but life is too short
to eat mediocre granola, so for the first batch, I like to stick with someone
else's formula.

This granola was delicious just on its own, with a glass of milk, or atop the smoothie
bowl we make pretty frequently for breakfast. I'm still tinkering with that recipe
(and haven't gotten up the nerve to ask the restaurant for theirs).
