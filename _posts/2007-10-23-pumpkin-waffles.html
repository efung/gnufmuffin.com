excerpt: "An involved, weekday morning project that was ultimately very satisfying. I converted the basic recipe into a gluten-free one by replacing the flour with the same amount of a basic gluten-free mix and added a rounded ¼ tsp. of xanthan gum. Waffles might be the perfect candidate for this kind of conversion"

I converted the basic recipe into a gluten-free one by replacing the flour with the same amount of a basic gluten-free mix and added a rounded ¼ tsp. of xanthan gum. Waffles might be the perfect candidate for this kind of conversion as I don't find the texture compromised and it even makes it fluffier. I also used natural yogurt stirred into some milk instead of buttermilk. Delicious with strong spice and pumpkin flavours, a great way to use up leftover puree.
