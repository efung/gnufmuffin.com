Once in a while, I get a craving for a Chinese dessert soup. And during
the recent lunar new year, it was as good an occasion as any to make one
of my favourites. Despite years of encouragement and convincing, no
one else in my immediate family has acquired a taste for a sweetened
porridge made from beans, seeds, and flower bits.

Perhaps [_tong sui_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_sui) is one
of those things you have to eat growing up to continue enjoying as an
adult. As a kid, we knew these in Cantonese, literally, as "red beans",
while I only learned the name "azuki" or "adzuki" later in life. I
also ate them exclusively in a sweet soup, only making dishes like
[sekihan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2015/09/25/food/recipe-magic-beans-good-luck/) 
when I began to cook for myself.

There are countless recipes for red bean porridge online, but the
one I make was taught to me by my father. I captured
his [recipe](/recipes/red_bean_soup.html) a really long time ago, 
on paper, and am finally putting it online for posterity.

This soup is pretty easy to make. Don't skip the steps of soaking
some of the ingredients, as nobody likes hard bits in their soup.
And it's essential that you put in the extra effort to ensure the 
lotus seeds are tender. And, **this is key**, don't skimp on the 
ingredients: red bean soup is more than just red beans.
