As a final treat to my coworkers, I decided to make a fancy-ish cake. This one from Malgieri's cake book combined a lot of my favourite flavours and didn't seem difficult to make, especially since I was going to do it all on a weeknight.<br /><br />The original recipe calls for fresh raspberries and a raspberry eau-de-vie. My first setback was difficulty in finding framboise at a local liquor store. Instead of driving around to different LCBOs, I settled on a bottle of Fragoli, a wild strawberry liqueur. I thought the little tiny fruit floating in the bottle would make for an interesting garnish. At the supermarket, I bought strawberries to use in the filling of the cake.<br /><br />The cake was a nut sponge, made with a little bit of flour. I made sure to beat the yolks until they were very light and foamy, and also to grind the nuts finely (using a bit of the flour in the processor bowl). I didn't have a 10" tin, and the cake baked up fine in a 9" one. While that cooled, I set to work making the syrup and ganache filling. I had a lot of leftover milk chocolate, so I used about a 50:50 ratio of bittersweet to milk in the filling. Leaving the bowl of ganache outside helped to cool it quickly.<br /><br />For assembly, the cake held up nicely after splitting but was still delicate so handle it gently. I didn't have any cardboard rounds, so I put together the cake right on the base of a portable cake carrier. With a little less surface area due to the smaller pan size, the cake didn't need all of the strawberry syrup. After spreading the bottom cake layer with ganache, I sliced several strawberries, patting them dry before arranging them all over. A layer of whipped cream was next, followed by the top piece of cake. Masking has never been a skill of mine, so I covered the cake as best as I could. Making the rosettes was a bit messy, as the small quantity of ganache melts quickly in your hand, and you need it to be stiff enough so that the piped stars hold their shape. I put the cake in the fridge overnight to let the flavours meld and the cream and ganache to firm up.<br /><br />The next morning, I arranged the tiny wild strawberries on top, and also sprinkled nuts on top. I used a smaller 7" springform ring held carefully over top to contain the nuts to a neat circle. Finally, I used a vegetable peeler to make chocolate curls and pressed them sloppily onto the side of the cake.<br /><br />What a delicious combination of flavours! I really liked the berry flavours throughout (soaking the cake, and in the cream) as well as the contrast of crunchy and soft. Having a layer of ganache in the middle was a nice surprise. Highly recommended.
