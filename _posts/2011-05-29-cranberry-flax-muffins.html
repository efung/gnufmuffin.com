excerpt: "This healthy-sounding recipe looked good to me, high in fibre and low in sugar and fat. We\'ve had a package of flax seeds in the freezer forever, and we always have dried fruit in our cupboards so I was all set. This is my first baking project since our son was born, and it didn\'t look too complicated."

We've had a package of flax seeds in the freezer forever, and we always have dried fruit in our cupboards so I was all set. This is my first baking project since our son was born, and it didn't look too complicated.&nbsp;I used a spice grinder to pulverize the flax in batches. Other than that extra work, the muffins are pretty standard.<br /><br />These turned out to be <i>too</i>&nbsp;healthy tasting: a little coarse and dry. Perhaps a bit more fat or sugar would be nice, or spreading some honey butter on them. I like the idea of incorporating ground flax, so I'll be on the lookout for more recipes of this type. Oh one more note: my yield was 18 medium sized muffins.
