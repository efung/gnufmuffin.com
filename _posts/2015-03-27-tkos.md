This is the second cookie I made from [Bouchon
Bakery](/tag/bouchon-bakery/) this week. It's a version of a
classic cream-filled chocolate cookie, the initials standing for 
<b>T</b>homas <b>K</b>eller <b>O</b>reos.

The
[recipes](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/thomas-keller-bouchon-bakery-tko-chocolate-sandwich-cookie-recipe.html)
seemed simple enough: a rolled dough sandwiched with a ganache.
On Tuesday, I made a double-batch of the chocolate
shortbread dough, rolling it out, cutting 2" fluted circles out of it,
and baking them off. I wasn't ready with the filling yet, so I kept the
baked rounds in an airtight container.

However, things started to go south over the next few nights. The
ganache filling needs at least 4 hours to set in the fridge. On my
first, and most disastrous, attempt, the chilled filling was extremely
runny, and definitely not pipeable. The [reports on
TKOs](http://bouchonbakerybookproject.blogspot.com/2013/01/tkos.html) from the 
project that worked their way through the book also mentioned how runny
the filling was.

A little research indicated that my usage of white chocolate chips was
likely a problem: they have very little cocoa butter. The next day, I
went to a local Bulk Barn and bought a piece of white chocolate:
unfortunately, the label did not indicate the cocoa butter percentage.
For this second attempt, I added a few tablespoons of powdered cocoa 
butter to help set the ganache, and then chilled the mixture once more.

This was also a failure: not only was the mixture still runny, but it
had a weird off taste, from the cocoa butter I added. I learned
something else from this failure though: agitating the chilled ganache
vigorously did make it slightly thicker, but not enough to pipe though.

On Thursday night, I dropped by [Domino
Foods](http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/vendors/vendor_detail/64) in St.
Lawrence Market, and picked up a block of Callebaut white chocolate,
with a minimum cocoa butter percentage of 28%. I also price checked the
Valrhona Ivoire 35% (which the recipe actually specifies) over at Lifely
Life, but wasn't going to pay $50/kg for it!

To ensure this filling would set, I deviated from the recipe, and went
with a more traditional 2:1 ratio of chocolate to cream. This time, the
filling was much thicker, and I was able to pipe little teardrops on the
cookies and make a few dozen sandwiches. It seems ridiculous to pipe it
like this, since it's time consuming, and is purely decorative.

I wouldn't make the TKOs again. They don't really taste like Oreos,
and aren't all that exciting for the effort I put in.
