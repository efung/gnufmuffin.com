It promised a shiny top and a chewy texture obtained through a careful balancing of saturated vs. unsaturated fats, just like the ones from Betty Crocker. While the appearance of the brownies turned out like CI described, they weren't all that chewy, not that I minded. There wasn't an intense chocolate flavour, but more than enough for my taste. There are several other brownie recipes in their archives, plus the ones in Shirley Corriher's new book, so I have lots more to try before I can pick my favourite.
