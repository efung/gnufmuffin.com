[Banana](/tag/banana/) bread, [carrot](/tag/carrot/) cake,
[apple](/tag/apple/) pie: these are baked goods that I'm always
willing to try a new recipe for. This "double" apple pie from
[Melissa Clark](http://www.melissaclark.net) in the New York Times
incorporates apple butter, which I happened to have [made
earlier](/2016/10/sweet-and-chunky-apple-butter.html).

Compared with other apple pies that I've made, [this
recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016924-double-apple-pie)
doesn't call for the apples to be precooked. For flavour, it
incorporates apple butter, as well as a lot of spices. The crust
is all-butter, but the author calls for blind baking it. While this
ensured that the bottom was dry and crisp, it does add time and
effort.

Would I make this pie again? Not exactly as written. The idea of
boosting flavour with the apple butter is a good one, but I felt
all the other spices competed with a pure apple flavour. Slicing
the apples so thinly also led them to break down too much; I prefer
a pie with larger wedges of fruit. And lastly, a lattice crust
yields patches with two layers of crust, making it a little awkward
to break through with your fork.
