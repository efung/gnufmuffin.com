excerpt: "Lots of interesting ingredients including beets, olive oil, ginger, orange and polenta. Batter mixes up purple. This turned out nothing like the photograph in the cookbook: it\'s very purple, dense and moist, like a pudding (in fact, it\'s called surprise pudding in the index). Oliver tends to use quantities"

Batter mixes up purple. This turned out nothing like the photograph in the cookbook: it's very purple, dense and moist, like a pudding (in fact, it's called surprise pudding in the index). Oliver tends to use quantities like &ldquo;a handful&rdquo; or &ldquo;heaping spoonful&rdquo; so perhaps my &ldquo;juice of one orange&rdquo; made this cake too wet. Anyhow, a good way to use up beets.
