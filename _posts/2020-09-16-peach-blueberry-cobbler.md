This has been a great year for late summer fruit. Our [farm boxes](https://www.thamesrivermelons.com/)
have consistently provided us with amazing produce all summer long. 
These past few months, there have been plenty of blueberries, and
we've gotten some enormous, juicy, flavourful peaches from Costco
too. This week, I put together a simple dessert that was delicious
right out of the oven, but became less and less appetizing
the next day.

The [recipe](http://sourcherryfarm.com/2010/07/24/recipe-blueberry-cobbler/)
comes from one of my favourite cookbooks. Regan Daley's recipe is
pretty straightforward, and can use a mix of stone fruit and berries.
I chose white peaches and blueberries. Without having to peel the
fruit, the prep was quick and easy.

I substituted self-rising flour in place of the AP, salt, and baking powder. 
Because my peaches were so sweet and ripe, we cut back on the sugar in the filling.
The cobbler baked up beautifully, with a deeply browned topping, and a
perfectly fluid but not runny filling. I loved the cooked fruit with the fluffy
biscuits to sop up the juices. Unfortunately, as the hours and days went by,
the topping began to soak up more and more of the filling. Cobblers are
definitely for crowds, where every last spoonful can be enjoyed while it's 
still warm.
