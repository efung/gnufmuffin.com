Brioche isn't good for you. With a flour-butter ratio of 2:1 or even
closer, and a healthy amount of eggs, it's an enriched bread that could 
easily pass as a pastry. That didn't stop me from trying *Bouchon
Bakery*'s recipe for _craquelins_, a brioche made with orange and
sugar.

# Sunday morning

I don't like store-bought orange peel, but it's such a chore to make
your own. In the end, taste triumphed over convenience. On Sunday
morning, I began by blanching the hollowed out shells of three oranges.

I needed to go out, and left the orange halves in the hot water. When I
came back a few hours later, I cut the halves into strips, and simmered
them in a heavy syrup, for just under an hour, as I had to go out again.

I poured the candied peels into a jar, and put it in the fridge.

# Sunday evening

The craquelins [recipe](http://www.frenchtarte.com/2015/02/craquelins-belgian-brioche-treat-from.html)
yields 12 buns, but I wanted to double it, since I planned on bringing
some to work. I made the starter and let it ferment while we had dinner.

When it was ready, I dumped the flour, sugar, salt and starter into the
mixer bowl, then added the eggs. This is where my 575-watt, 6-quart
KitchenAid stand mixer began to groan. The recipe said to knead for 15
minutes (!) but my machine overheated at the 3 minute mark. I took out
the partially kneaded dough, weighed out half, and after a 15 minute
rest for the machine to cool down, resumed kneading the smaller portion.

The mixer held up, and I slowly added the butter. It's important that it
be at room temperature so it will incorporate easily. Even though I've
made brioche a few times before, it's still a bit astounding to see how
much butter you can actually blend into bread dough. This is what it
looks like when it's done:

I used a generous amount of flour to keep the buttery dough from
sticking to the counter, as you need to be able to flatten it out, and
fold it, as if making laminated dough. Once it sat for an hour, I
sprinkled the orange zest and candied peel on top, then kneaded it in,
and gave it a few more folds.

By this point, it was pretty late, so I'm glad that it needed an
overnight refrigeration.

# Monday morning

I set my alarm for 06:00, and scaled out the dough into 12 equal
portions by weight.

After pushing a sugar cube into each one, I placed the balls of dough 
into the mini panettone papers, glazed them with egg wash, and let them rise.

About two hours later, they were ready for another egg wash and a
sprinkle of sugar (the recipe calls for pearl sugar, I mistakenly bought
and used sanding sugar).

I needed the full baking time to develop a golden brown exterior. Our
house smelled *amazing* while these were in the oven.

These buns were incredibly fluffy and tender. They weren't overly
greasy, and had a strong orange flavour. I'm not sure the whole sugar cube
added much, and would have preferred smaller bits scattered throughout.

I'd make these again, but maybe as a once-a-year kind of treat.
