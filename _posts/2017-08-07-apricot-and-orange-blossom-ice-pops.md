At the farmer's market on the weekend, I optimistically bought
a whole basket of Ontario apricots after tasting a sample. After letting
them ripen for two days, I turned them into perhaps one of the most
flavourful and satisfying ice pops I've made this year.

The [recipe](https://fancyfoodfancy.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/apricot-cream-pops/) 
comes from the People's Pops [book](http://www.peoplespops.com/shop/peoples-pops-cookbook). 
I stewed the apricots in a bit of water until they just started to
fall apart, drained them of the liquid, then pur√©ed them with simple
syrup. One teaspoon of [orange blossom
water](http://www.phoeniciaproducts.com/en/Prod.aspx?ProdSubCatid=35&ProductID=413)
(I used one by Cedar/Phoenicia) was enough to provide a fragrant,
complex flavour to the fruit mixture. Even though the apricots were
blended with their skins, they were not detectable at all.
I highly recommend making these, especially if you can get good apricots!
