For a dinner my wife hosted for her grad students, we made a
vegetarian chili and wanted cornbread to go with it. The version
in [Bread Baker's Apprentice](/tag/the-bread-baker%27s-apprentice/)
is one I've made a few times before, but have never written about.
It's easy to make, and is full of corn flavour.

The night before, I soaked medium-grind cornmeal in some buttermilk.
The [recipe](http://leitesculinaria.com/7175/recipes-cornbread.html/print)
says you can leave it out overnight at room temperature. I placed
it by an outside door, just in case. On the morning of the
dinner, I made the batter, adding a few tablespoons of freeze dried
corn powder for extra flavour and colour.

The recipe says you can use a 10" round pan, or a 9Ã—13" pan, or a 12" square
pan. These have _wildly_ different surface areas! The difference,
obviously, is that the cornbread will either be thicker or thinner, but
it also changes the baking time. I used a round, 12" cast iron pan, and
it was done in 30 minutes.

As we were keeping it vegetarian, we omitted the bacon from the
original. Reinhart actually suggests making chicken or turkey
cracklings to sprinkle on top: something to keep in mind for next time.

This is not a fine-crumbed cornbread, but one that is moist and full of
niblets. I made it with [spicy
honey](http://bushwickkitchen.com/products/bees-knees-spicy-honey) and
served it with a compound butter, made with the same honey. In the
future, I'd probably use a bit less corn, so that the cornbread would be
drier, and more suitable for soaking up sauces or gravies.
