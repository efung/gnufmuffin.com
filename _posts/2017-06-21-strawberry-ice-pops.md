It's strawberry season again in Southern Ontario, and this past Sunday,
big G and I dropped by the Leslieville Farmer's Market to pick up a flat
from the Bizjak Farms stall. That evening, my son requested a crumble
made with rhubarb and berries, but I had more ideas for what to do
with all that fruit.

Scouring my various cookbooks and favourite sites (e.g. [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/),
[Saveur](http://www.saveur.com/)), I settled on three different strawberry
ice pop recipes made over three consecutive nights:

# Strawberry-Passion Fruit Popsicles

The recipe comes from Emily Luchetti's _A Passion for Ice Cream_.
I already had a partially open package of passion fruit pur√©e in
the freezer. Instead of juicing and straining pulp from fresh fruit,
these frozen packs are far more economical and convenient, and are
always available from Latino groceries in Kensington Market.  The
balance is perfect: just enough tropical aroma and pucker
to enliven the familiar taste of berries.

# Strawberries and Cream

Saveur's [recipe](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Strawberries-and-Cream-Ice-Pops-Paletas-de-Fresas-y-Crema)
is likely similar to many others out there, incorporating a bit of cream into a 
standard ice pop base. I liked this one the least: there wasn't enough cream to 
make it stand out from a straight strawberry recipe.

# Strawberry and Bitters

This [recipe](http://wannacomewith.com/2014/08/strawberry-bitters-popsicles/)
is from the People's Pops book. They suggest using 1
to 2 tablespoons of bitters per batch of 8 ice pops. I made a half
batch, and used the full (scaled) amount of Angostura bitters to ensure
the flavour would be detectable. Straight out of the freezer, I don't
think I could identify the mystery ingredient: it tastes more like
cardamom to me. But it's an out of the ordinary combination.
