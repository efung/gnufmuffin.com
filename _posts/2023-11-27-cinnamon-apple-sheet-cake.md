If you have a lot of apples, and need to feed a lot of mouths, 
this might be the cake for you.

I was initially attracted to this [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021570-cinnamon-apple-sheet-cake) because of the picture. The giant
wedges of apple on the cake, surrounded by a dusting of icing sugar
makes for a very attractive appearance.

The cake itself is made from a rich batter: two sticks of butter,
five eggs, two and a half cups of sugar, and sour cream. I found it a
little too dense and too sweet. The apples I used (Gala) didn't bake
up soft enough, which made it hard to eat with just a fork. This was
just okay, and is a good choice if you want an apple cake and don't
want to do a lot of chopping.
