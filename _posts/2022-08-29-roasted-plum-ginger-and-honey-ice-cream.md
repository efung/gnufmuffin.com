We have so many plums that I'm repeating crowd favourites. This
plum ice cream recipe was a big hit at a dinner we were invited
to a few weeks ago, and my daughter and I re-made it recently
with a few improvements to bump up the ginger flavour.

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/roasted-plum-ginger-and-honey-ice-cream-recipe)
is from Serious Eats, and calls for two pounds of plums. Here's what that amount of our 
golf ball sized plums looks like:

This summer, we've had a real bumper crop of this stone fruit. Any extra fruit
we can't eat right away, I pit, cut, weigh, roast, then freeze. Here's two 
pounds of roasted plums. The colour from the skins comes out when the 
flesh starts to break down:

The first time we made this, I wasn't too careful about measuring the ginger.
The flavour was pretty muted, so I kept adding powdered ginger to up the
zing, but it tasted like powdered ginger. On our second go around, 
I Microplaned the ginger, measured out two tablespoons, then my daughter 
added some chopped candied ginger. Both times, we used a fragrant honey and
a plain brandy.

This is another standout ice cream, not too heavy or rich since
it's not made with any eggs. All the flavours play together so
nicely: the plum is tart, the honey sweet, and the ginger adds a
bit of background heat. Highly recommended. I would make this again,
especially with blue plums to get the beautiful mauve colour.
