As a thank you to friends who were doing us a favour on Saturday
morning, my wife volunteered me to bake something. I found a 
scone recipe that sounded easy to make, and would feature a seasonal
fruit.

My experience with [scones](/tag/scones/) is that you can't skimp on the
fat, or you end up with a dry, crumbly mess. So I was a little skeptical
of a reader-contributed
[strawberry scone recipe](http://www.creativehomemaking.com/cooking/strawberry-scone-recipe.shtml)
published in Cook's Illustrated's sister publication, Cook's Country.

But, it turned out alright. The dough is pretty easy to work with, and
the berries didn't make too much of a mess. Note that the recipe calls
for 2/3 cup strawberries, chopped. But I used 2/3 cup chopped
strawberries. Whether that was the intention or not, I think even more
fruit would have been fine in this recipe. The baked scones were
tender, with just the right amount of sweetness. These need to be eaten
fresh though, or they'll dry out by the next day.
