I happened across <a href="http://pghtasted.blogspot.com/2008/06/tall-and-fluffy-buttermilk-biscuits.html">these biscuits</a> and pulled out the CI issue from my shelf. The technique for making these fluffy biscuits involved dropping the wet dough onto a baking sheet covered in flour, then forming balls and arranging them in a cake tin. True to their name, these biscuits were very fluffy but I wouldn't call them tall but I also didn't have double-acting baking powder which the recipe recommends. If you're looking for a nice easy biscuit, and don't mind making a bit of a mess, this recipe fits the bill.
