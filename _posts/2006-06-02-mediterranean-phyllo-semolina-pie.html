excerpt: "The authors say this is a Lebanese dessert but don\'t give the name. I found recipes online for muhallebili baklava which don\'t use egg, and galaktoboureko which is pretty similar to the one in this book. I only used 10 layers each for the bottom and top so it wasn\'t very flaky. There are no flavourings"

I found recipes online for <span style="font-style:italic;">muhallebili baklava</span> which don't use egg, and <span style="font-style:italic;">galaktoboureko</span> which is pretty similar to the one in this book. I only used 10 layers each for the bottom and top so it wasn't very flaky. There are no flavourings (e.g. cinnamon, lemon zest, rosewater) so this version is a bit one-dimensional (along the ultrasweet axis).
