excerpt: "I think there\'s a misprint in the book: the yield is supposed to be two 9&times;5&times;3\" cakes, but as you can see, the loaves came out very short. The Classic Pound Cake recipe a few pages back uses the same amount of flour, butter and eggs and makes one loaf. I sent Nick a question on his website"

The Classic Pound Cake recipe a few pages back uses the same amount of flour, butter and eggs and makes one loaf. I sent Nick a question on his <a href="http://nickmalgieri.com/questions.html">website</a> and will report back here. The batter seemed quite dry until folding in the whites. Although matcha isn't a flavour I particularly like, this cake was good, buttery and light, with a very fine crumb due to the confectioner's sugar, and a slight crunchiness on the edges from the egg whites.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update:</span> I've confirmed with Mr. Malgieri that this is indeed a misprint. The yield is <span style="font-weight:bold;">one</span> loaf.
