The clear plastic tubs contain watery, flavourless dark cherries that are a far cry from a decent, firm-fleshed specimen. After I saw this recipe on Tartelette, I thought it would be a good way to use up an extra container. I replaced the coconut milk in the original recipe with more heavy cream, and left the rosebuds in the infused cherry mixture overnight. The absence of egg yolks meant it was quick to put together.<br /><br />This was a pretty good ice cream with the rose-scented cherries coming through subtly. As to be expected, the custard-less base was a little cold and icy, without a rich mouth feel, but the combination with cherries is a winning one.
