Summer is when the produce of Ontario really shines, especially in the 
[Golden Horseshoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horseshoe) region.
3L baskets of peaches are on every fruit stand, farmers' market table,
and supermarket display. As a once-a-summer treat, I decided to make
a pie, using Sam Sifton's recipe from the New York Times.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017525-perfect-peach-pie)
includes a homemade crust and filling. All the butter is added at once to
the flour, and blitzed using a food processor until some fat is pebble
sized. An egg yolk adds tenderness and makes the dough more pliable.
The _fraisage_ technique of smearing the hunks of fat promotes flakiness.

To keep the pure flavour of peach, I made the filling without adding
the nutmeg. AP flour is the thickener, but you could use tapioca or 
cornstarch instead. Strangely, the recipe doesn't tell you to chill
the assembled pie, nor place a pan or sheet of foil underneath to
catch drips in the oven. As someone with dozens of pies under their
belt, I did both of these things.

At the minimum time of 45 minutes, my pie was bubbly and the crust
nicely browned. What a wonderful pie: perfect balance of sweet and 
tart, flaky and soft, and juicy but still easy to eat. Frozen leftover 
slices, reheated in a moderate oven, were excellent.
