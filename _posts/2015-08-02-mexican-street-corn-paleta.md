I remember the success of last year's [corn ice
cream](/2014/08/sweet-corn-ice-cream-with-blueberry.html), so when I saw
this recipe for a corn, sour cream, and lime popsicle in a recent
issue of the New York Times Magazine, I knew I had to try it.

The
[recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017572-mexican-street-corn-paleta-corn-sour-cream-and-lime-popsicle)
is from an
[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-sweetness-of-mexico.html)
by a Times' columnist writing about [Fany
Gerson](https://twitter.com/fanygerson) sharing her Mexican
culture through food. I have a bit of a crush on Gerson, ever since watching a
[video](https://vimeo.com/21576604) about her donut shop. We were able
to partake of both the

and 
[paletas](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/10309417864/in/album-72157636389551566/)
on our last trip to NYC.

To make these paletas, I made half the given recipe, stripping the
kernels off 4 small cobs to get 2 cups. Serranos aren't readily available within
walking distance of my house, so I settled on a whole jalapeño. After
pureeing the corn mixture in a VitaMix, there was quite a bit of froth.
Once the sour cream and lime juice and zest were added, I left it in the
fridge to chill, while I sauteed the remaining kernels in some salt and
butter.

To freeze the pops, I spooned the chilled, sauteed kernels into the
bottom of each mold. The butter made them stick together a bit but
I did my best to separate the individual niblets. After letting the
filled molds freeze for half an hour, I used the ice pop sticks to
distribute the corn bits into the slush so they would be suspended
evenly.

These paletas really taste like Mexican street corn. The individual
ingredients all combine to make an ice pop that is both sweet and
savoury. There's a bit of textural interest too, since the roasted
kernels come out kind of chewy. The corn we used wasn't the
corniest, unfortunately, so the base flavour isn't very strong. 

I would not use the jalapeño in the future, or let it simmer for
so long: it left an unpleasant vegetal taste and was a bit too
spicy. I've had better success in the past using a dried chili
pepper, like an arbol or pequin.
