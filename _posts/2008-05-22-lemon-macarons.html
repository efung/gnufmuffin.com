What intrigued me was the use of natural ingredients to colour the macarons, in this case, turmeric. I've reluctantly purchased vials of food colouring but try to use as little as possible, and only when absolutely necessary. Instead of gently oven-drying the sugar-almond-turmeric mixture as described, I heated the turmeric in a toaster oven for a while to release the oils, then left it uncovered for a few days, hoping that the strongest aromas would dissipate. Another great feature of this recipe is that it uses whole eggs in the lemon curd, so it is a net consumer of egg whites! I made a double batch of the macarons (but only using 1 tbsp of turmeric) and correctly guessed that a single batch of the lemon curd would be more than enough. I got about 30 medium sized macaron sandwiches. While the tanginess and colour of the completed cookies are fantastic, I can definitely taste the turmeric, even with the reduced quantity.
