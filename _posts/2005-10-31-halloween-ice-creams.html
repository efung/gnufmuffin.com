excerpt: "I heated 2 cups milk with 1 cup cream and added that to 4 egg yolks, &frac12; cup sugar and 6 tbsp. of sesame paste. Return to heat until slightly thickened, cool, churn, etc. The sesame paste was made by combining instant black sesame powder with a bit of hot water. For additional flavour, I also added"

Notes: Substitutions: regular carrots instead of baby; orange-tangerine juice instead of orange; vodka and tangerine zest instead of tangerine liqueur. It's reminiscent of an orange popsicle, the carrot flavour is quite muted, but it's way WAY too sweet. Bright colour.</p><p class="outdent"><b>Black Sesame Ice Cream</b>: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9123652/">Recipe</a> loosely adapted from <span style="font-style: italic;">Nobu, the cookbook</span>. Notes: I heated 2 cups milk with 1 cup cream and added that to 4 egg yolks, &frac12; cup sugar and 6 tbsp. of sesame paste. Return to heat until slightly thickened, cool, churn, etc. The sesame paste was made by combining instant black sesame powder with a bit of hot water. For additional flavour, I also added a bit of vanilla, and some toasted and <a title="in my suribachi, a Japanese mortar and pestle">ground</a> black sesame. Not as dark coloured, or strongly flavoured as I hoped for.</p>
