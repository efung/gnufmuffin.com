I love anything made with [lemon](/tag/lemon/). One of my all-time
favourite desserts is a _tarte au citron_, with its mouth-puckering
filling. An iced lemon loaf is pretty good too, but only if it
isn't subtle. This lemon cake wasn't the "best" exemplar I've ever
had or made, but it was pretty damn good.

The [recipe](https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/The-Best-Damn-Meyer-Lemon-Cake)
comes from Saveur, and includes lemon three ways: as zest, juice, and extract.
I didn't have the latter, but found a substitute in a LorAnn Gourmet [natural emulsion](https://www.lorannoils.com/lemon-natural-bakery-emulsion-4-oz-0758-0800) that was water-based. I didn't know the relative strengths
of extracts vs emulsions, so I used a bit less, about one-and-a-half tablespoons.

This cake turned out pretty good, remaining tasty even several days after.
The lemon syrup you brush on the hot cake gets absorbed, providing moistness
and intense flavour. There was something "off" with the emulsion's
flavour: it wasn't necessarily artificial, but there was definitely an 
aftertaste.

I'd like to continue to experiment with incorporating citrus in desserts. On
my radar is Shaker Lemon Pie, which uses two whole lemons, thinly sliced. 
And, Orange Supreme Muffins, which include the segments of two navel oranges 
in its batter.
