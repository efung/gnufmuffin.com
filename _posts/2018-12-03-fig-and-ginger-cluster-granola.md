As smoothie bowls have entered into our regular breakfast rotation, 
Dr. S and I need a regular supply of granola as one of the toppings.
We've been pretty happy with the various [granolas](/tag/granola/)
that have come out of our kitchen, but I'm always looking for new ideas.
I found [Tara O'Brady's](http://sevenspoons.net/about-seven-spoons/) take
on this cereal concoction, in her cookbook, [_Seven Spoons_](/tag/seven-spoons/).

Not only did her [recipe](http://www.healthygreenkitchen.com/taras-fig-and-ginger-cluster-granola.html)
have dried figs and crystallized ginger, it also had **candied cocoa nibs**. 
It was marked optional, but how can you omit **sugar-coated chocolate**?
Most granola is just assembly, combining your oats, nuts, and seeds with 
your sweetener and your fat (yup, everything tasty has lots of fat in it).
The [BraveTart version](/2018/08/crisp-buttermilk-granola.html) calls for
soaking the oats in buttermilk, and the twist in this recipe, is grinding
some of the oats into flour, to help bind everything together.

I thought this granola was pretty good, but my family wasn't a fan of the figs.
I liked how the ginger provides little bits of heat, while the cocoa nibs provide
the bitter notes.
