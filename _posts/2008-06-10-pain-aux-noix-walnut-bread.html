excerpt: "This bread has walnut oil in the recipe and both white and whole wheat flours in it. To fit my schedule, I relied on the time-saving cold fermentation technique.

To fit my schedule, I relied on the time-saving cold fermentation technique. After mixing up the dough on Monday night, I let it proof in my very warm apartment for about an hour, then put it in the fridge. When I came home after seeing a movie, I punched the dough down, then kneaded in the walnuts and returned the shaped loaves to the fridge. The next morning, I took them out for about an hour before baking them. The loaves are deliciously soft and nutty. This would make a nice bread to serve at dinner, but I ate it with jam for breakfast.
