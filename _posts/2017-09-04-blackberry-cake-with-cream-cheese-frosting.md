For a Labour Day picnic at a park, we and a group of families decided to order 
pizza. But, of course, we augmented the takeout with homemade baked goods,
adult beverages, fruit, etc. My contribution was this striking blackberry cake,
whose interior was tinted a pale purple.

As soon as I saw Stella Parks' [recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/08/blackberry-cake-recipe.html),
I was really excited to try it. Costco had a mountain of blackberries for sale,
so after a weekend trip, I was ready to bake. It turned out that 7 ounces of
fruit isn't that much, and I only needed one out of the three packages that I bought.

The directions are very precise about both the weight and the temperature
of the ingredients so take note. I was pleased that my cake turned out so
nicely. For a flat appearance on top (and so that I could snack on cake
bits), I trimmed the dome of the cake before frosting. I didn't need the
whole batch, and saved the leftover for cupcakes or carrot cake.

We ended up eating slices of this cake with our hands, as we ran out of
paper plates. Everyone really enjoyed it, especially the berries garnishing
the top. I would definitely make this again, maybe turning it into a layer
cake, with blackberry jam!
