excerpt: "While reading about Sam Mason, I came across another one of his recipes that begged to be tried. Since I don\'t have maltodextrin nor high acyl gellan, I wasn\'t able to make the apple puree, but I did want an apple component to go along with the miso ice cream. The salted dried plums are disgusting"

Since I don't have maltodextrin nor high acyl gellan, I wasn't able to make the apple puree, but I did want an apple component to go along with the miso ice cream. The salted dried plums are disgusting so I didn't want that and the tart crumbs seemed optional to me.<br /><br />The ice cream recipe itself has a few non-standard ingredients: I subbed xanthan gum for the stabilizer, and corn syrup for trimoline. <a href="http://www.galleriasm.com/eng_main.asp">Galleria Supermarket</a> sold a mild shiro miso (a bit less sodium than regular shiro miso) which I used here. Adding the milk powder to the cream mixture resulted in lots of little lumps, but after incorporating the miso, a hand blender smoothed out everything.<br /><br />While apple confit has few ingredients, the prep requires considerable time. I made the cinnamon caramel powder using plain cinnamon (who has a smoker?!?). My food processor made nice thin slices of the Fuji apples I used, and I layered everything in a small glass oblong dish. A lot of liquid comes out but this gets absorbed back as it cools.<br /><br />On the whole, this was a very interesting dessert, with much commentary from my tasters. I liked the salty-sweet flavour of the ice cream, combined with the bitter-sweet taste of the apples.
