excerpt: "I baked this in a 13&times;9 baking pan which fit everything nicely. The plums I used were Damson ones, which are small and quite tart. Baking made them even more acidic so a good accompaniment for this is ice cream. My last batch of Crumble SurpriseTM, an odds-and-ends frozen baggie of leftover crumble"

The plums I used were Damson ones, which are small and quite tart. Baking made them even more acidic so a good accompaniment for this is ice cream. My last batch of Crumble Surprise<sup>TM</sup>, an odds-and-ends frozen baggie of leftover crumble topping, went into this cake. I didn't like this so much: the bread base isn't flavourful, nor is the topping. Next time, I would chop the nuts more finely and add some spices to the plums.
