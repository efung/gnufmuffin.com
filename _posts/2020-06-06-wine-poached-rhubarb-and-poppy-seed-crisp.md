We've been enjoying our market box deliveries from [Thames River Melons](https://www.thamesrivermelons.com/),
a fruit and vegetable farm, an hour and a half drive west of Toronto. We're not 
going to be able to browse the market stands this summer, so I'm glad Dr. S
found out that Thames was delivering. During May and June, about 3 pounds of 
rhubarb arrived in our box every week. What we couldn't use of the
tart stalks, we've washed, diced and frozen. The remainder has gone
into making various crisps, and this week's variation was definitely
out of the ordinary.

I made a double batch of this 
[recipe](https://www.saveur.com/ovenly-wine-poached-rhubarb-poppy-seed-crisp/) from
Saveur, contributed by the bakers at [Ovenly](https://www.oven.ly/), a
bakery from New York City. I made a few minor substitutions out
of necessity (whole wheat flour for rye, lime zest for orange). The
quarter cup of cornstarch seemed like a lot, so I didn't double
this quantity.

This recipe is a bit more involved than others: you need to pre-bake the
topping so it stays crisp, and you also need to cook a portion of the rhubarb
into a jam. This is stirred into the raw rhubarb and strawberries before
baking, so some of the fruit stays whole, providing some textural contrast.

I made a **critical error** though: instead of fresh strawberries, I used
an equivalent amount of frozen, sliced berries, **which I didn't thaw**.
The cold fruit meant it took a lot longer for the filling to bubble and boil
in the oven, so the rhubarb remained quite under-cooked by the time the
crisp topping browned.

My family gave this dessert a pass. Not only were they put off by
the undercooked rhubarb, they didn't like the poppy seed topping.
I thought that the wine, various spices, and technique added a ton
of complexity to an otherwise commonplace dessert.

After a few days in the fridge, the topping got quite moist, and
couldn't be revived even in a toaster oven. I would use less butter
next time.
