The reviews are in: last week's [rhubarb crisp](/2020/06/wine-poached-rhubarb-and-poppy-seed-crisp.html),
containing unconventional ingredients like red wine and poppy seeds, was **not** well received.
Our household prefers more conventional flavours, which disappoints me, as I always like to
try new things. To appease the majority, I turned to something more straightforward. In the process,
I learned that tapioca is not always tapioca.

Stella Parks, writing for Serious Eats, came up with the
[recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/04/rhubarb-crisp-recipe.html). I decided to
stick with 100% rhubarb, but she does offer a variation that includes strawberries. To start,
I made the topping, which has five-spice powder, whole wheat flour, and pecans (sorry family, I
have to sneak in _some_ interesting flavours).
I omitted anise seeds, and swapped brandy for elderflower liqueur, because I didn't have either of those
two things.

Making the filling is a two-part process: Half of the fruit is baked with the flavourings and
thickeners, in a covered dish. At the 30 minute mark, the hot mixture was _really_ thick, like, I could
slice it. After stirring in the baking soda (which helps neutralize the acidity of rhubarb),
I added the rest of the raw fruit. This made the mixture a bit looser, but it was still quite 
thick. I was pleased with how much topping there was, as it's always everyone's favourite part.
**Make sure you place the assembled crisp on a baking sheet!** This recipe completely fills a deep, 9" 
pie dish, and IT WILL BUBBLE OVER.

That spilled-over filling turned into a chewy fruit leather, an excellent snacking opportunity.  The 
topping was nicely browned and baked up crisp, a complementary accompaniment to the mouth-puckering filling. 
Most importantly, my family enjoyed eating this crisp.

Finally, there's a note in the recipe pointing out
that tapioca starch made outside of the US may be derived from [sago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago),
and not from true tapioca, aka [cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca). The two
have different gelling properties. That might explain why the half-cooked filling was so thick.

I almost always buy tapioca from the Asian grocery, with
brands from Thailand. And I've always been a little put off by the metallic, citrusy flavour
in anything I thicken using "tapioca". Time to get some cassava-derived tapioca, and do a little
test.
