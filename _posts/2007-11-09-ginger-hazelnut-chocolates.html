excerpt: "I was planning to make the cinnamon-hazelnut chocolates but found my own blog post (!) so I altered the spicing of this recipe. Instead of cinnamon, I infused the cream with fresh ginger, added ground ginger (about 1 tsp) to the ganache and also some candied ginger puree. For the molded shells and ganache,"

Instead of cinnamon, I infused the cream with fresh ginger, added ground ginger (about 1 tsp) to the ganache and also some candied ginger puree. For the molded shells and ganache, I used Callebaut 823, a 34% milk chocolate. Although I was careful with the tempering, I accidentally overheated the chocolate to about 34&deg;C when bringing it up to the working temperature. Perhaps that's why there's some streaking and blotchiness. I did invert the molds this time so I'm very pleased with the thickness of the sides. (I found a nice illustrated <a href="http://www.blackwidowbakery.com/demo/chocolates/index.html">page</a> about the basic process of making molded chocolates.) Unmolding gave me lots of trouble though so I'm pretty sure my tempering was off. However, a pretty tasty chocolate, more gingery than hazelnut.
