I wanted to host a dessert party on a weeknight for some out-of-town
colleagues visiting Toronto, but the plan fell through. I had already
done some prep earlier in the week, like making some delicious
orange-cardamom spiced nuts. Nevertheless, I went ahead and made
a cake containing an unexpected savoury ingredient.

The [recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/78036-burnt-miso-pound-cake)
is by Christina Tosi, and can be found in her _All About Cake_
cookbook, which I do not own. If you're a fan of Momofuku, you
probably know that miso butterscotch was used on the dessert menu
in the restaurant's early days. I've never made it before, but new
tastes are my jam, so you know I had to try it.

The first step is to make the burnt miso, by spreading it thin and
baking it until it dries out and the natural sugars caramelize. I kept
repeating "Don't be a ninny!" to myself while watching the edges get
blacker and blacker.

Next, that deeply browned soybean paste is blended with the liquid
ingredients (buttermilk, oil, melted butter, eggs), and then
combined with the dry ones to make the batter.

I needed a bit of extra time for the cake to be fully cooked, as the batter
below the crack was still wet when I checked at the 75 minute mark. It was
also very dark near the edge of the pan, so I covered the whole thing with
foil for the last 15 minutes.

The slices were really moist, and only had a hint of funky and salty
umami-ness. Maybe the organic shiro miso I used was not particularly
flavourful.

But the real star was the accompanying cream: a mix of equal amounts
sour cream and whipping cream, lightly sweetened. It provided a 
cool and rich contrast to the warmed, toasted cake slices.
Unfortunately, I don't really have anything positive to say about
the apple compote recipe: for 200g of apple cubes, it called
for an equal amount of sugar. I halved it, and still found it
too sweet. And one whole teaspoon of cinnamon was way too much too.

All in all, an unusual, but enjoyable dessert, that could be made
perfect with a few tweaks to the apple compote.
