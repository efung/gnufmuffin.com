Another cake from <span style="font-style:italic;">Desserts by Pierre Hermé</span> by Dorie Greenspan; in French, he calls it <span style="font-style:italic;">Régal au Riz Basmati</span>. There are six components: ladyfingers, lemon syrup, crunchies, rice pudding, chocolate cream and caramelized puffed rice. The <span style="text-decoration: line-through">madness</span>procedure is described below:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535407/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/146535407_fedbb821de_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat - Ladyfingers" /></a>The instructions contain a useful tip to pipe the bands first while the batter is at its fullest. I ran into trouble during baking: my top oven rack was too high and consequently browned the biscuits before they were fully baked.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535362/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/47/146535362_b4caaf7991_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat - Lemon Syrup" /></a>Just a simple lemon zest infusion.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535332/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/50/146535332_85fd43ad46_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat - Crunchies" /></a>A clever way to tie in the ingredients in the form of a <a href="http://www.nestle.com/Our_Brands/Chocolate_Confectionery/Crunch/">chocolate bar</a> combining milk chocolate with puffed rice. There's some toasted chopped hazelnuts too in this mixture.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535272/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/56/146535272_9db48f99b0_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat - Rice Pudding" /></a>The pudding was quite time consuming. The rice is cooked with whole milk, cinnamon and lemon and must be cooled to 70&deg;F. At that point, it is very stiff and congealed. The second step is to make a <span style="font-style:italic;">crème anglaise</span>; don't skip straining it as such a small quantity of custard is easy to overcook. Gelatin is added at this point. When it too has cooled to 70&deg;F, the mixtures are combined together with some whipped cream.<br /><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535222/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/146535222_08209acf1e_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat - Assembly (1)" /></a>For assembly, the ladyfingers are brushed with the syrup and placed in a cake ring. The rice pudding goes in the bottom, then the crunchies, and then the other ladyfinger disc.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535185/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/54/146535185_28ab5ee600_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat - Assembly (2)" /></a>After the rice pudding has firmed up, the last component is a chocolate cream. Don't let it cool too much or it won't be pourable.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535155/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/51/146535155_1864e7b6e0_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat - Caramelized Rice Krispies" /></a>Making this finishing touch is optional in the recipe but highly recommended. The first step is to heat a wet sugar mixture to the firm ball stage (248&deg;F) then stir in the Rice Krispies. After washing the extremely hot saucepan, you reheat the Rice Krispies again to caramelize them.<br /><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/146535116/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/146535116_cf5a59de2f_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Crispy and Creamy Rice Treat" /></a>Cross-section of the finished cake. It's got loads of texture and all the components work really well together. catalepticat made this <a href="http://samuraidelicatessen.blogspot.com/2006/02/crispy-and-creamy-rice-treat.html">too</a>. <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
