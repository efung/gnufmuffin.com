Dr. S has been wanting to take me to this annual holiday since we met, as she thinks it's the most fun Jewish observance, filled with drinking, costumes and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grogger"><i>groggers</i></a>.<br /><br />This recipe from the NY Times seemed to be a good place to start. Other ones I looked at used cream cheese in the dough or had raisins; for various reasons, these wouldn't do. Anyway, I started with the dough, one made with egg yolks, butter and icing sugar. Next, the filling: poppy seeds cooked in milk. I substituted cranberries for raisins. I read a long time ago in a cookbook (Bonnie Stern? Can't remember.) that the only way to properly pulverize poppy seeds is an a grinder made for that purpose. My coffee mill/spice grinder worked pretty well. The finished filling had a weird taste, not sure if that's just what poppy is normally like, or whether they had gone stale.<br /><br />The refrigerated dough (that I kept in the fridge for a day) was initially hard to work with, but quickly became malleable and soft. It tended to stick to the counter, so I had to use a mini offset spatula to lift the circles away. My circles were a bit on the small side, so I made quite a few hamantaschen. They baked up nicely, with very few of them bursting open.<br /><br />I must admit that they were a bit disappointing. The dough was sugary and the filling had an unusual flavour. Dr. S said they weren't like the ones from her childhood. Next year, we'll try a different recipe.
