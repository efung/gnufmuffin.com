For a Christmas lunch we were invited to, I wanted to make something
more child friendly than cheesecake, i.e. something with chocolate.
Brownies were the obvious choice. I don't have a go-to recipe, so I
looked for something that was easy to make as I would be in my in-laws'
kitchen.

Calling a recipe perfect or best or ultimate is a bit arrogant. It's all
subjective. But I decided on this
[recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/04/perfect-best-brownie-recipe.html)
because it yielded a single square pan, and could use up some of my
bittersweet chocolate bar (I'm still working my way through that
gigantic 5&nbsp;kg slab).

There aren't too many tricky steps in a dessert as simple as brownies,
but here are a few reminders. Make sure to thoroughly combine the
chocolate and melted butter, lest your brownies come out greasy and
slick. Sift your flour and cocoa powder (and your leaveners for good
measure) so you don't get unappetizing lumps in the batter. And don't
overmix so they come out tender.

Once baked, I let these cool to room temperature before wrapping. In the
morning, I cut the pan into equal squares to serve. The brownies were
okay, not over-the-top chocolatey. They leaned more towards cakey,
rather than fudgey, but I might have overbaked them a little bit.
Definitely not my favourite, but a solid, basic brownie is what this is.
