The next marker of summer for me, fruit-wise, is stone fruit: cherries, peaches, plums, apricots, etc.
This year hasn't been so great, in my humble opinion. The cherries have been a bit soft, the apricots
have been typically mediocre, and many of the peaches I've eaten have been tiny specimens. This week,
I turned a basket of nearly overripe peaches into a sorbet that was dull and lacklustre.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/4094-gingered-peach-sorbet) is due to Molly O'Neill
and sounded like a sure winner. In addition to whole peaches (skin and flesh), the recipe adds
a bit of spice (ginger and nutmeg) and a bit of vanilla also. My mistake was to let the puree
sit in the Vitamix overnight in the fridge. The next morning, the mixture had darkened and the
flavour had muddied.

The sorbet was also very granular, and not smooth. I think the reason was an imbalance between sugar
and liquid. Instead of specifying a volume or weight for the puree, the recipe just specified whole peaches,
which vary greatly size. Also, it needed the brightness from a few teaspoons of lemon juice. Oh well, it's 
still a treat to have a frozen dessert during these hot summer days.
