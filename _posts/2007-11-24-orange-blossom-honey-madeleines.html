excerpt: "Lots of flavourings in this classic tiny cake recipe: orange blossom honey, orange blossom water and orange zest. There\'s some ground almonds too, which Yard says she uses for flavour and lightness. The recipe says to chill the batter for 2 to 4 hours; I was tired after coming home from a concert so"

There's some ground almonds too, which Yard says she uses for flavour and lightness. The recipe says to chill the batter for 2 to 4 hours; I was tired after coming home from a concert so I refrigerated it overnight and took it out a few hours early this morning. It doesn't take long to warm up the batter, so about 1 hour would be enough next time. The orange blossom water is a little overwhelming (even though I enjoy it): one teaspoon would be plenty. The floral-citrus aroma makes this a very enjoyable cake nonetheless.
