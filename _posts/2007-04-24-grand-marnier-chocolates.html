There isn't a very strong orange flavour, only alcohol. Steeping some orange peel with the cream would have helped. I found it best to freeze the filling for at least two hours before cutting squares. Otherwise, the ganache tends to stick to the knife. The tops were decorated using a transfer sheet, acetate that is printed with coloured cocoa butter. Recent warm weather made it difficult to hold these chocolates at a cool room temperature. Quite a bit of sugar bloom was evident after letting the finished product sit overnight.
