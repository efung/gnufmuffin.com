excerpt: "The only substitution I made was milk-diluted yogurt instead of buttermilk. And I foolishly tried to make a double batch in 12 regular-sized tins. The tops of the tins were completely covered, so it looked like a bumpy cake. Because of this over-filling, the muffins were slightly underbaked by the time"

And I foolishly tried to make a double batch in 12 regular-sized tins. The tops of the tins were completely covered, so it looked like a bumpy cake. Because of this over-filling, the muffins were slightly underbaked by the time the tops were browned. Flavour-wise, Dr. S enjoyed them a lot; I didn't think they were too bad either. Very moist and tender. I would try these again, but the non-standard yield means some annoying conversion to fill a dozen muffin tins.
