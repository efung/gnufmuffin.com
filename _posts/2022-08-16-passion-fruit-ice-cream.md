My daughter has taken a real liking to fresh passionfruit. These dark purplish orbs contain an
extremely fragrant pulp, with little black seeds that pop between your teeth. However, they're expensive,
ranging from $1.50 to more than $2 each. Fortunately, we've been enjoying the frozen purees
from manufacturers like Canoa and Del Campo, which are much more economical.

As part of an ice cream making binge recently, I made the passion fruit ice cream
recipe from the _Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream_ cookbook. It's a pretty straightforward
ice cream recipe: make the custard base (I used 6 yolks, instead of 8), then stir
in the tropical fruit puree. Chill, churn, serve!

Top marks for this ice cream. The bracingly tart-sweet flavour is still
evident, but balanced by the custard. Of the several homemade ice creams
I had in the freezer, this was the one that my family always reached for first!
