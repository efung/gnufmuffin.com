For my dessert entry, having an impressive appearance was one of my goals. This cookie has always been in the back of my mind ever since I bought the book. On the first day, I made the doughs and chilled them. On the next day, I let them come to room temperature, then shaped them. Do pay attention to the measurements so that everything fits together. I found it difficult to achieve the bread loaf shape. Every time I squashed from the top, the bottom would get smushed. Slice the dough very thinly, otherwise the finished cookie sandwich will be too thick. Another caveat: cutting the sandwiches on the bias causes the PB and J to ooze out everywhere. I tried to mitigate this in several ways: putting less filling before slicing, slicing then filling, and using a very sharp serrated blade, but none of these techniques solved the problem completely.<br /><br />In the end, I was not the victor (a brownie won). But I think these cookies are very fun, and certainly were impressive to look at.<br /><br />Here's <a href="http://ipso-fatto.blogspot.ca/2010/04/childhood-delight-reimagined-chocolate.html">Ipso Fatto's rendition</a>.
