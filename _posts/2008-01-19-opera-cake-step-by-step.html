I wanted to make a fancy coffee-chocolate dessert for a dinner party and didn't have any luck finding <span style="font-style:italic;">Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Hermé</span> in several bookstores. In the end, I decided on the classic Opera Cake using the detailed recipe <a href="http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/recipes/dessert_opera.shtml">here</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2209511836/" title="Opera Cake - Joconde Batter by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2228/2209511836_5d0673aaa2_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Opera Cake - Joconde Batter" /></a>The cake layers are based on a recipe that has ground almonds. I overbeat the egg whites somewhat so that they became grainy and difficult to smoothly incorporate into the batter. You can see a few specks of egg white in the photo. I rotated the pans top to bottom during baking, and needed almost double the time to get the cake lightly browned. The directions for cooling are unnecessarily complicated so I just let them cool right in the pan.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2209512264/" title="Opera Cake - Moistening with Coffee Syrup by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2191/2209512264_a565756853_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" class="inlineleft" alt="Opera Cake - Moistening with Coffee Syrup" /></a>Even though the cake layers have a lot of structure from the egg whites, they're still very delicate. Such a large sheet is prone to cracking when you pick it up, so be gentle. I placed the bottom layer on a piece of wax paper on top of an inverted sheet pan (so that I would be able to easily move it). There is a lot of coffee syrup so I was generous with brushing it on.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2209512748/" title="Opera Cake - Coffee Buttercream by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2255/2209512748_1567558f61_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Opera Cake - Coffee Buttercream" /></a>I made a buttercream recently so had a bit of experience to draw on. This one had yolks in it and far fewer egg whites and the quantity was smaller. When it was done, I popped the mixer bowl into the fridge for five minutes at a time, then whipped it for 10 seconds. Once it was firm enough to be easily spreadable, I gently scraped it into a bowl, avoiding the crystallized sugar on the sides of the bowl. Next time, I'll chill it for less time, since it was tricky to spread it evenly without damaging the cake.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2209513246/" title="Opera Cake - Chocolate Ganache by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2282/2209513246_c0a2df4bbc_t.jpg" width="100" class="inlineleft" height="75" alt="Opera Cake - Chocolate Ganache" /></a>For the chocolate ganache, I made use of the microwave to heat the small quantity of milk and cream. I also didn't bother to beat the butter, as it was very soft already. After I chilled the ganache in the fridge for a bit, I let it sit at room temperature while I  worked on the bottom layers. Unfortunately, the ganache started to set, so I needed a brief amount of time over a double boiler to make it spreadable again.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2208718043/" title="Opera Cake - Chocolate Glaze by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2362/2208718043_e70bdec046_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Opera Cake - Chocolate Glaze" /></a>After assembling the cake layers, I let it chill in the fridge for about 5 hours. The glaze has a lot of clarified butter, so I made sure to stir it thoroughly.  You have to work quickly with the glaze as it starts to set on the cold cake immediately. I didn't use an offset spatula to smooth the top, choosing to fix gaps with a spoon and ended up with an amateurish surface.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2208718387/" title="Opera Cake - Decoration by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2317/2208718387_87537f4b03_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" class="inlineleft" alt="Opera Cake - Decoration" /></a>The classic decoration is edible gold leaf and the name of the cake piped in melted chocolate. In keeping with the musical name, I piped treble clefs in tempered white chocolate, and also tried several variations of writing the word Opera. I chilled the pieces as the small decorations got soft quite quickly.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2208718689/" title="Opera Cake - Layers by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2050/2208718689_702b581957_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" class="inlineleft" alt="Opera Cake - Layers" /></a>The layers are relatively even so I was pretty pleased. The cake is very easy to cut with a sharp knife. To keep the edges from drying out, I tried to cover them with strips of acetate but the natural curl in the plastic made it difficult to adhere securely.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2209514792/" title="Opera Cake by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/2209514792_ca84edc01c_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" class="inlineleft" alt="Opera Cake" /></a>The finished cake. I cut it into twenty 2&times;2&frac12;" pieces. I agree with <a href="http://www.alacuisine.org/alacuisine/2004/10/opera_cake_1.html">Clement</a> that it's better served at room temperature or warmer as the buttercream and ganache are too firm otherwise. The flavours are well-balanced and combine into a wonderful dessert. Highly recommended!
