I could never bring myself to actually purchasing a slice of Crack PieÂ®.
It sounded way too sweet and plain to me. But something inspired me to
try baking it at home this week, and so on Wednesday evening, I set out
to make this notorious dessert.

The first bit of the
[recipe](http://milkbarstore.com/main/press/recipes-and-how-tos/#crackpie)
is easy: an oatmeal cookie dough baked as a large flat slab. My
pantry and local grocer didn't have old-fashioned oats, so I just
used quick-cooking oats. I spread the dough into half of a half
sheet pan.

The filling was quite easy to make. I substituted salted butter, in
place of the sweet butter and salt called for in the recipe. The mixture
is really wet and was barely emulsified.

It's hard to tell from the following photo, but after the specified
baking time, the interior was still soupy. It didn't just jiggle, but
sloshed around underneath the barely set surface. I gave it about 10
extra minutes and hoped for the best.

After an overnight freeze, the pie separated a little bit, with a thin
film of butter settling on the edges. Served refrigerator cold, the pie
was a bit runny, but tooth-achingly delicious. The oat crust provided a
crunch, while the rich filling had a complex flavour that almost made
you forget how much dairy and sugar it contained. 

From my online searches, there have been many reports about runny
Crack Pie fillings. If I ever made this again, I would try baking it for
a longer time, possibly covered towards the end. Then again, why
wouldn't you make it yourself, considering that the restaurant charges
$48 per pie?

**Update**: I tried the real thing from Momofuku a few weeks
later, and the interior was baked through, but the slices were very
thin. Perhaps the secret is to use a larger diameter pie shell, and/or
filling it less?
