I went back to the Bouchon cookbook in search of an easy dessert I could
make. With only an hour of prep time before we had to leave, I decided
on a cookie dough that required refrigeration, i.e. left outside in the
snow, and could be baked at our friend's house after dinner.

Having made a few things from the [Bouchon
Bakery](/tag/bouchon-bakery/) book before, I knew that I'd have to
carefully weigh everything, even eggs. The
[recipe](http://joanne-eatswellwithothers.com/2013/11/bouchon-bakery-chocolate-chunk-and-chip-cookies.html)
is pretty straightforward though. Here is my mise en place, clockwise
from top left: dry ingredients, sugar and molasses, choocolate chunks and 
chips, and eggs.

The recipe's a bit fussy in places: Keller wants you to sift the
chocolate chunks so that the little bits don't melt and darken the
cookie dough. Even though the quantities are small, it's not too bad to
make this in a stand mixer.

I didn't have a #10 scoop, so I mashed together two scoops from a #20 
with the assistance of a 3-year old. The dough balls are *big*. 
Flattened slightly, they resemble giant hockey pucks. I needed about 23
minutes for them to get nicely browned.

The cookies were soft and slightly chewy, with lots of chocolate in every
bite. A single one is almost too much to eat in one sitting, but great
for sharing.

While my wife and our friends loved them, I felt these cookies were 
missing something. There's no flavourings in this recipe, no vanilla 
and no espresso powder. I guess it's meant to be a pure chocolate chip
cookie recipe. There is a variation using cocoa powder which I'm going
to try next.
