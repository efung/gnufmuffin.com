The freshly made dough was easy to scoop and portion using my scoop, and the cookies baked to a smooth, rounded finish. However, after a day in the fridge, the batter became very solid, even after letting it sit on the counter for a few hours. Since white chocolate is solid at room temperature, I'm guessing that's what caused it to be so firm. This batch baked up craggy and kept their shape more. I was able to get two dozen cookies from this recipe, using level scoops from a #24 scoop. Very tasty: rich, sweet, scented with vanilla and butterscotch.
