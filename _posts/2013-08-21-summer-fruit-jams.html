Much of it has been turned into peach crumble or a peach cake (which we froze), but on one evening last week, we decided to make two batches of jam.<br /><br />The apricot jam was made using the reduced sugar pectin. It is very hard to find the no-sugar versions in the supermarket (there's one by Certo), and we usually reduce the sugar by a quarter and/or increase the fruit by a quarter. This makes for a runnier jam, which is how we like it anyway. Our apricots were probably some of the best we've had from Ontario, juicy, firm and sweet, but without a pronounced apricot fragrance that I've only <a href="http://www.utne.com/environment/apricots-zm0z12mazwar.aspx">read about</a>. The finished jam was a bit tart, but the texture and flavour were marvellous. The directions on the pectin box are meant to guarantee success, if you define that as being a firmly-set, sweet jam, regardless of the quality of your fruit. But with experience, I know how much I can deviate from the sugar and fruit quantities, and still make tasty jam.<br /><br />We also bought a package of liquid pectin for making freezer jam. This product must be pre-sweetened, because it didn't require a lot of additional sugar. We used a hand blender to break down the blueberries, following the recipe as given, but reducing the sugar by a bit. Since we had our canner set up for the apricot jam, I sterilized the jars, a step that is not necessary for freezer jam. The next morning, the jam had set up quite thickly, and had a delicious blueberry flavour. Too sweet, in my opinion, though.<br /><br />At this point, we have four kinds of jam sitting on a shelf, and I just bought some New Haven freestones this past weekend with the goal of making another batch!
