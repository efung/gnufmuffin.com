It seemed like a good candidate for my annual fruitcake baking and was quite easy to make. Tasters weren't able to detect the olives, wanted more alcohol and moistness, and one found it too sweet. I thought the flavour was quite interesting, not complex, but a nice snacking fruitcake that you could eat several slices of. For the big upcoming bake, I'll double the quantity of Frangelico, reduce the salt somewhat, and keep a closer eye on the baking time.
