excerpt: "The key ingredient in this bread is Graham flour which has an interesting history. Given the ubiquity of graham crackers (which I love in cheesecake crusts), I was dismayed to find out that the raw flour isn't so easy to find. Over the past few weeks, I've had no luck finding it at Whole Foods, Healthy"

Given the ubiquity of graham crackers (which I love in cheesecake crusts), I was dismayed to find out that the raw flour isn't so easy to find. Over the past few weeks, I've had no luck finding it at Whole Foods, Healthy Planet, The Big Carrot or any number of other health food stores. In the end, I ordered a package <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Bobs-Red-Mill-Organic-Graham/dp/B00DII24FA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404350854&sr=8-1&keywords=graham+flour">from Amazon.ca</a> as an Add-On item. Shortly after, I discovered the same Bob's Red Mill package at my local, dinky Foodland. Who knew?<br /><br />Sadly, this bread didn't work out. It began with a starter which I made from all graham flour on a Sunday morning. However, in retrospect, the total amount of active dry yeast in this bread wasn't quite enough to give this 100% whole grain bread enough lift. The finished bread didn't rise very much during the final proof, and had zero oven spring. Its texture was crumbly, resembling a "healthy" bread. We threw out both loaves.
