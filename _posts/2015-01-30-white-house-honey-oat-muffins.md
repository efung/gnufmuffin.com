We baked a few times during our month in Florida: brownies, muffins,
challah, etc. Back in Toronto (where the temperature was about
40&deg;C colder), I made a batch of breakfast muffins on a Friday
morning that turned out to be plain, but tasty.

The name of the
[recipe](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/white-house-honey-oat-muffins)
seems designed to be memorable or rank highly in search results.
The only connection with the White House is that the chef who
developed it was inspired by the beehive in the garden of the
presidential residence. Anyhow, I wanted to try it because it used
honey as the exclusive sweetener and included cardamom as a spice.

The batter is oil-based and can be made easily by hand. It was quite
runny so I let it sit for 10 minutes before portioning.

A sprinkle of rolled oats on top, and they were ready to go into the
oven. They were well-browned at the minimum time, and I probably could have
reduced that by a few minutes owing to my dark tins.

These are pretty plain oatmeal muffins. Not too sweet, with a light
texture thanks to all that leavening. I always like nuts or raisins in
my muffins, but it's nice to have a simple muffin once in a while.
