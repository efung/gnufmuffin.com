This is my contribution for the January 2006 <a href="http://becksposhnosh.blogspot.com/2006/01/low-is-new-high.html">Sugar High Friday</a> hosted by Sam; the theme is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sugar Low</span>. I knew I wouldn't make anything that used artificial sweetener, because, well, I try to use natural ingredients as much as possible. Plus, I don't believe in low-fat or low-sugar (I prefer the philosophy of everything in moderation). So, my take on this event was to make a dessert that would incorporate a natural sweetener.<br /><br />At a fundraiser book sale last year, I picked up a couple of back issues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gourmet</span>, including the August 1993 issue that featured several unusual ice creams. For example, the magazine has recipes for Fresh Corn, Guinness Stout, White Pepper, and Chocolate Chili ice creams. I suppose nowadays, these flavours may be pedestrian in some circles, but a decade ago, they were probably very <span style="font-style:italic;">avant-garde</span>. The <a href="http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/bldes96.htm">recipe</a> that caught my eye is attributed to Charlie Trotter's restaurant in Chicago and paired the distinctive flavour of rosemary with honey, an interesting combination that I had to try.<br /><br />I started the cream infusion by dumping a litre of <a title="roughly the same as whipping cream and half-and-half combined">table cream</a> over the rosemary and letting it come up to a simmer. Note that recipe online says 32 to 42 sprigs: I think they mean rosemary leaves, as the version in the magazine calls for six 3- to 4-inch sprigs. To avoid giving my tasters a heart attack, I scaled back from eight eggs to five then whisked the yolks together with the honey. I substituted plain sugar with maple sugar, dissolving it in the cream infusion rather than the eggs as it had dried out somewhat.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/91771483/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/30/91771483_e350299973_m.jpg" class="inlineright" width="240" height="180" alt="Rosemary Honey Ice Cream" /></a><br /><br />After neglecting my cream (don't do this!), during which it boiled over, I slowly tempered the egg mixture by stirring a small portion of the infusion into the yolks, then pouring it all back in the saucepan. When it reached 170&deg;F, I took it off the heat, then strained the custard into a bowl. Before it came to room temperature, I pressed some plastic wrap on the surface so a skin wouldn't form, and chilled it in the fridge.<br /><br />The verdict? My first spoonful was so unexpected that I thought I had made a mistake in following the recipe. The flavour seems vegetal (carrot-like) at first, then the subtle notes of rosemary reveal themselves. More than one taster detected a ginger taste; it <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> have that flavour, but without the characteristic spiciness. Honey makes a perfectly fine sweetener for ice cream, so it's an ingredient I'll try to use again. If I had followed the directions and used the richer creams and the full amount of eggs, this would have been a rich and luxurious dessert. But, in keeping with the theme of <span style="font-weight:bold;">sugar low</span>, this reduced-fat version, free of any refined sugar, still turned out quite nicely.
