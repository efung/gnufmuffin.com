A case of a dozen Ataulfo mangoes can be had for about $15 CAD
if you know where to shop. The problem is, they all
start to ripen at the same time. I had the brilliant idea of making
a pudding that would use up a lot of the fresh, ripe fruit, but it
turned out to be a dud.

A Cantonese-style chilled pudding is essentially a soft set Jello.
I have fond memories of eating milk pudding flavoured with almond 
extract in a rabbit mold, served with canned fruit cocktail. The easiest
way to make mango pudding is to prepare it from a packaged powder
(Robertsons is a common brand) and add some mango chunks. But we're
"from scratch" bakers in this house!

The [recipe](https://thewoksoflife.com/mango-pudding/#recipe) I tried
comes from the excellent site, _Woks of Life_.
It calls for blending a mango puree with water, gelatin, sugar and
condensed milk. I subbed some regular milk instead, reducing some of 
the water.

My biggest complaint about this recipe is that the flavour is quite
mild due to all the water that's used. Why not use something like
mango nectar or juice? And maybe a touch of lemon juice would be
nice too. Because of the fresh puree, and how fibrous many mangoes
are, the texture is not smooth like Jello but I don't have any
problem with that.

I'll keep looking for another recipe for mango pudding. I might even
invest in a rabbit or fish mold for future experiments!
