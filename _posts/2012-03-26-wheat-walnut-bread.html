excerpt: "I\'ve made walnut bread once before, using a recipe from maybe The Bread Bible. It turned out quite dense and dry, so I haven\'t tried to make it again. But with a Costco-sized Costco-purchased bag of walnuts on hand, I decided to try again. Many of the breads in Bread Alone call for a 20% wheat bran"

It turned out quite dense and dry, so I haven't tried to make it again. But with a Costco-sized Costco-purchased bag of walnuts on hand, I decided to try again. Many of the breads in Bread Alone call for a 20% wheat bran flour. This isn't a common type of flour that's readily available, so I've always hesitated to try any formulas that call for it. This time, I decided to substitute with Robin Hood <a href="http://www.robinhood.ca/product-details.aspx?pid=196&prodcid=44">Nutri Flour Blend</a> which is milled so that it has the same amount of bran as whole wheat, but tastes like white. There's both ground and whole walnuts in this bread, which gives it a very nutty flavour and texture. I couldn't find cracked rye at bulk burn, so I used rye flakes instead. This is a wonderful loaf, how I imagine a good walnut bread to be. Complex flavour, nice chew.<br /><br />Here's two photos from Lien (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/notitievanlien/3459344640/in/set-72157617083079594/">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/notitievanlien/3459344952/in/set-72157617083079594/">[2]</a>), and one from <a href="http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/4351/wheat-walnut-loaf">Bart</a> on The Fresh Loaf.
