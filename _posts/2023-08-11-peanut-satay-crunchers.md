Continuing my jaunt through _Fabulous Modern Cookies_, I was delighted
at how these Southeast Asian-inspired bites turned out. Who knew red 
curry paste had dessert applications?

I'm open to the idea of a savoury-sweet mix, given that the 
[gochujang caramel cookies](/2023/02/gochujang-caramel-cookies.html) 
were so delicious, and I loved the 
[chili crisp ice cream topping](/2020/07/sichuan-chile-crisp-sundae-with-peanut-streusel.html). In this recipe, the authors call for peanut butter,
coconut flakes, and curry paste to make up the satay flavour. You never know
how hot any brand of curry paste will be, so I erred on the side of 
caution. The one I used turned out not be spicy, but instead, very
gingery, lemongrass-y, and garlicky.

I thought these cookies were really interesting and delicious, but
didn't really capture the essence of satay which invokes grilling
and more complex spicing. The peanut and chili flavours, with the
chewiness of the coconut, made for interesting bites.
