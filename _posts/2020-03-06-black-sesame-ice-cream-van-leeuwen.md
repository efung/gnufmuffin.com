As a kid, I _loved_ [black sesame soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sesame_soup) (黑芝麻糊).
It was inky black, smelled and tasted like peanut, and a stark visual contrast
to the white porcelain bowls we ate it from. This weekend, I made 
a mediocre black sesame ice cream, but I definitely want to make a better batch in the future.

The [recipe](https://www.foodrepublic.com/recipes/van-leeuwens-black-sesame-ice-cream/)
comes from the _Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream_ book. It calls for
using 3 tbsp of black sesame seeds to make a paste from scratch,
but I thought, I've already got black tahini! I substituted an
equivalent amount by weight for the raw seeds, and kept the same
amount of sesame oil and sugar.

Right away, during churning, I was disappointed in the pale gray colour of the mixture.
Obviously, it didn't get darker after the ice cream ripened. Flavour-wise, it tastes
mostly of sesame oil, and is on par with most commercial black sesame ice creams I've
tried. It was only a few days later that I learned the 
[secret](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/10/how-to-make-black-sesame-ice-cream.html) 
of getting the deep flavour and colour that I want. Look for a post once I make
the new and improved batch.
