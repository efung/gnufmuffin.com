excerpt: "While in Florida, I got a chance to make a loaf of challah to enjoy on the weekend. On Friday morning, I made the dough with the only modification being a reduction in the sugar to accommodate some diabetics. I did the first rise at room temperature. After punching down, I put the dough in the fridge."

On Friday morning, I made the dough with the only modification being a reduction in the sugar to accommodate some diabetics. I did the first rise at room temperature. After punching down, I put the dough in the fridge. Just before going out for dinner, I pulled up a document on <a href="http://www.delmarlearning.com/companions/content/141801169x/student/Braiding%20Techniques/index.asp">braiding techniques</a> and followed the guide to make a 5-strand high braid. Back into the fridge it went while we went for dinner. A few hours later, I applied an egg wash and baked the bread.<br /><br />This loaf wasn't my best: I didn't like the asymmetric look of five strands and the flavour was a bit bland (i.e. not sweet). For a <i>pareve</i> challah, it's not bad.
