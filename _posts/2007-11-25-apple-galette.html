excerpt: "I was able to find pastry flour (Bob\'s Red Mill unbleached) so I used that in place of all-purpose. Five medium-sized organic Granny Smith apples were enough to cover this tart, but they were odd-shaped slices, especially the part around the core.

Five medium-sized organic Granny Smith apples were enough to cover this tart, but they were odd-shaped slices, especially the part around the core. Next time, I would use more apples and select the nicer slices. The crust was very easy to roll out (I used the full 9 tbsp of water) and turned out somewhat tender, more cracker-like. Shrinkage made the apples somewhat sparse, I'd pack the rows tighter in the future.
