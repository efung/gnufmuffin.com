excerpt: "There\'s always some flavour-boosting step to CI recipes and for these muffins, making blueberry jam is it. However, it\'s not as complicated as it might sound, just simmering berries with a bit sugar until it\'s reduced. There are no good fresh local berries right now, so I used some frozen ones instead,"

However, it's not as complicated as it might sound, just simmering berries with a bit sugar until it's reduced. There are no good fresh local berries right now, so I used some frozen ones instead, but I skipped their recommendation to rinse and dry them. The muffin variation I made used ground almonds in the batter and also as a topping. Unfortunately, these didn't turn out as spectacular as I hoped they would. The dollop of jam ended up burning at the edge of the muffin tin and didn't provide a burst of fruit flavour. The muffin itself was dense and tough, but I probably overmixed it. I'm willing to make this again but with fresh berries when they come in season in the summer.
