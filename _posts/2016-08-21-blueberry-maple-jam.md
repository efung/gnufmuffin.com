The [7th Annual Wild Blueberry Festival](https://www.evergreen.ca/whats-on/event-details/12417/) 
was this weekend at the Evergreen Brick Works, and we took full advantage. In addition to
buying a large basket of berries, we bought more [peaches](/tag/peach/) and strawberries. After
putting our kids to bed, my wife and I set out to make three different jams on a weeknight.

I won't go into too much detail about the other jams, as we just followed the pectin box
directions for the most part. For the 100% peach jam, we used Pomona's pectin, adding
an extra cup of fruit, so that it had a softer set. For the strawberry-peach jam, 
we used Certo Light (reduced sugar) pectin, combining 2 cups strawberries
with 3 cups peaches, and 2 cups sugar. We knew this wasn't enough sugar to fully set the jam, but
we like a runnier consistency anyway, as well as preferring less sugar.

Our go-to reference and inspiration this summer has been the [Batch](http://www.wellpreserved.ca/batchcookbook/)
cookbook. This blueberry jam [recipe](https://houseandhome.com/recipe/blueberry-maple-jam-2-0/) is a formula
that the authors have been refining over the years. We used it as a guideline for our version, which was less
sweet, and was set with commercial pectin. Our quantities were:

<li><span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp lemon juice</span></li>

</ul>
</div>

The original directions call for macerating and crushing the berries
for a few hours, but we didn't have time to do that, so we skipped it. We basically followed the
pectin box directions, but our own ingredients. To avoid diminishing the incredible flavour of 
the berries, we omitted the cinnamon stick and lemon zest.

As we expected, the taste of this jam was _amazing_: a deep blueberry flavour, with maple notes. Summer,
captured in a jar (five, to be precise)!
