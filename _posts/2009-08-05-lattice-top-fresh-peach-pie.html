excerpt: "Instead of the original crust recipe, I used the newer CI vodka crust recipe. My peaches were very juicy and there was probably one cup of liquid in the bowl after I mixed in the sugar and tapioca powder. I didn\'t use any of the extra liquid, and the pie turned out fine. The lattice strips puffed up"

My peaches were very juicy and there was probably one cup of liquid in the bowl after I mixed in the sugar and tapioca powder. I didn't use any of the extra liquid, and the pie turned out fine. The lattice strips puffed up quite a bit, so I need to roll the vodka crust even thinner in the future. There's an odd, briny or pickle-like taste to the pie. I'm not sure if it's the peaches or the tapioca or the ground ginger I added. In any case, this is a simple, delicious way to use a basket of ripe, Ontario peaches.
