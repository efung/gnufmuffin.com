Before rhubarb fatigue sets in, I found a recipe I'd never
made before in one of my favourite books, 
[_In The Sweet Kitchen_](/tag/in-the-sweet-kitchen/). This tart
has a baked custard base encasing poached rhubarb and candied ginger, and a
crunchy sugar layer on top.

The
[recipe](http://awhiskandaspoon.com/2007/05/09/wcc16-rhubarb-brulee-tartlettes-with-ginger/)
has a small-ish list of ingredients, but there are multiple components
to make. I didn't need to make the _pâte brisée_, as I found a frozen
dough disc in my freezer downstairs, very likely an extra from the
[banana tart](/2014/12/warm-chocolate-and-banana-tart.html) project last
fall. The rhubarb filling is just the chopped stalks cooked soft with a
bit of brown sugar, and the custard is just _crème anglaise_.

For assembly, you brush a little jam on the bottom of the shells (I used
apple jelly), spoon some rhubarb filling and minced crystallized ginger
in, and pour over the custard. In a medium-low oven, you bake it until
the custard is barely set.

At serving time, you _brûlée_ some brown sugar on each tartlet. This is
the kind of fancy dessert to serve others, as it looks impressive, but
is not overly complicated to make. I suppose it depends on what you
think is complicated…

A few critical notes: there's a lot of leftover _crème anglaise_ if you
use a full two tablespoons of rhubarb filling per tart. I used the
excess to make French toast a few days later. While I enjoyed eating
this tart for difference's sake, I think I prefer pear and custard
better, and would use rhubarb in different applications.
