For a flourless dessert for Passover this year, walnuts were to be a
featured ingredient. Serendipitously, a walnut cake recipe was just
published in the New York Times. I made it, and it was fantastic.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018675-walnut-cake)
is by Yotam [Ottolenghi](/tag/ottolenghi/). After grinding (untoasted)
walnuts to small crumbs, you combine them with whipped egg yolks and
brown sugar. The whites are whipped separately, then folded into
the stiff nut mixture until it is lightened.

Since my pan was a 9" springform, and the tin was dark, I lowered
the temperature to 360Â°F. After 40 minutes, the cake was beautifully
browned. We brushed it with Grand Marnier (substituting for Amaretto).  
To serve, I made lemon curd (a perennial Pesach favourite) as well as
some plain, whipped cream.

Everyone commented on how moist this cake was. I loved the nuttiness
of it, and the subtle lemon zest flavouring. Another winner from
Ottolenghi. I can't wait for [_Sweet_](https://www.eater.com/2016/11/30/13793890/yotam-ottolenghi-sweet-cookbook-dessert), his new dessert book!
