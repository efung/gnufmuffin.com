I forgot to add any xanthan gum though. This may have accounted for the substantial spread in the baked cookies, or maybe this dough needs a lot of chilling. They look like boobs now, not buttons. The yield is way more than 3 dozen, as I tossed the first two dozen which were oversized and underbaked. I still ended up with 2 &frac12; dozen. These needed to be a deep brown on the edges before the centre was fully cooked. Deep hazelnut flavour, very buttery, crisp, yum.
