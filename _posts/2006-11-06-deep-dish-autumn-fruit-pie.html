excerpt: "The recipe in the link is terribly transcribed: it doesn\'t provide a recipe for the pastry (a pâte sucrée flavoured with orange-blossom water and orange zest); it also omits 3 Bosc pears from the ingredient list. The dough is very soft and I made the mistake of letting it warm too much after some time"

The dough is very soft and I made the mistake of letting it warm too much after some time in the fridge. When I folded it over itself to transfer to the pie plate, the dough stuck together! I ended up with a cobbler-like &ldquo;pie&rdquo; with patches of dough on top. The flavours are quite nice: some five-spice powder in the filling, a blend of fall fruit and orange in the pastry. I would reduce the amount of orange-blossom water next time, that stuff is strong (and soapy).
