Does anyone else get cravings for bran muffins? Sometimes, when I'm at 
[Tim Horton's](https://www.timhortons.ca/), I like to get a bran muffin.
It's pleasantly sweet, raisin-y, tender and coarse at the same time.
But, then I look at the [nutritional information](https://www.timhortons.ca/nutrition-and-allergens)
and am reminded that _every single one of their muffins_ has 
**more calories and carbohydrates** than any of their _**donuts**_.

So, as an avid muffin baker, I turned to making my own, since a
homemade one would surely be healthier than store-bought, right? 
Unfortunately, the [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-raisin-bran-muffin-recipe)
I used didn't have any nutrition facts. But it sure _seemed_
like it was healthier.

Aside from soaking the raw wheat bran in boiling water, the
batter was easy to make. It uses Greek yogurt, whole wheat flour,
a good dose of cinnamon, and raisins. Notably, it lacks
molasses, which is often part of most bran muffin recipes.
As noted in the directions, the muffin cups were quite full, and
the domes were quite peaked after baking.

Flavour-wise, these weren't as yummy as the ones from the
home of "Canada's Favourite Coffee". They're slightly 
dense, and were quite light in colour. I prefer my
bran muffins more moist, and darker. My favourite
still remains [these bran muffins](/2005/08/healthy-bran-muffins.html)
made from pureed prunes (!) instead of molasses.
But, I like that I can control the amount of sugar and fat, 
and knowing every ingredient that went into my breakfast.
