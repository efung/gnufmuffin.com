Muffins that feature an abundance of fruit, nuts and seeds are
sometimes called “morning glory” muffins. It turns out that a recipe
bearing this name was first published in <i>Gourmet</i> more than
30 years ago.  Despite its popularity, I tend to avoid muffins
overloaded with a lot of mix-ins. However, I am a big fan of Yotam
Ottolenghi, and his eponymous cookbook featured a morning-glory-like
muffin that sounded good enough to try.

The part of the [recipe](www.mueslilover.com/2013/11/recipe-ottolenghis-carrot-apple-and.html) 
that interested me was the topping: it was a crumb topping made
with seeds, oats and honey. In the first batch I
made, I didn't have pumpkin seeds, and also subbed sweet potato
for the carrots. At the minimum baking time, the muffins looked
quite wet and undercooked. After 15 more minutes, they looked ready.
Fresh out of the oven, they were amazing: a crunchy, textured topping
covering a moist interior filled with fruit and nut. They seemed a
bit too moist though, and could have used a few more minutes of
baking. After a day or two, the topping softened and wasn't as tasty.

For the second batch, I followed the recipe more closely, but reduced
the sugar a bit, and omitted the raisins. I still had plenty of
extra crumb topping from the first batch, so just added the missing
pumpkin seeds. I also raised the baking temperature to 375&deg;F.
These changes made only slight improvements, and I found the interior
to be still too wet. Overall, a good change to my usual breakfast
items.
