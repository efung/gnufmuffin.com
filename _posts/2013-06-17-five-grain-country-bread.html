excerpt: "While it had all the makings of a wonderful bread (sponge made with rye, whole-grain soaker, high hydration), this bread just didn\'t turn out for me. Note how flat and pale it is. The dough was really hard to work with, and never formed a ball. I was hesitant to add too much flour, for fear that it"

Note how flat and pale it is. The dough was really hard to work with, and never formed a ball. I was hesitant to add too much flour, for fear that it would get too dry. But a runny dough can't be shaped, so it ended up being a thick pancake. However, we made the best of it, slicing it into fingers, and freezing it. For breakfast, we toast individual pieces, and spread it with PB or jam.
