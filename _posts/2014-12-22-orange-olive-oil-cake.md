Our Hanukkah celebrations this year have involved many other families,
mostly in the form of potlucks. So I didn't need to make any dessert
as other people brought doughnuts, unlike [past years](/tag/hanukkah/). 
Still, I wanted to make _something_ I hadn't made before using olive oil, 
and produced this delicious cake.

One of my favourite baking flavours is citrus, so I was pleased that
this
[recipe](http://leitesculinaria.com/20321/recipes-portuguese-orange-olive-oil-cake.html) used both the zest and juice of fresh oranges. The batter
is not complicated, but requires the standard technique of
alternating the dry and liquid ingredients.

My baked cake rose nicely but I did have a lot of trouble getting it out
of the pan cleanly. Despite spraying it with PAM, it still stuck in a
few places. I might need a thicker coat, or maybe my old pan was too
dark or scratched.

This orange cake was moist and delicious, and one I would make again
without many changes (maybe a bit more zest).
