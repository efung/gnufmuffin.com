For a more kid-friendly treat (but who doesn't like pie???), I also
made two dozen madeleines for a Rosh Hashanah lunch we were invited
to. These were not great, although they did get finished after a
few days.

The [recipe](https://www.cordonbleu.edu/news/chocolate-dipped-honey-madeleines-recipe/en)
is from Cordon Bleu (the famous culinary school). The batter is quite thick
and didn't increase that much in volume when I added the browned butter.

We didn't have time to temper chocolate, so we just YOLOed it. I think chocolate
covered anything is a hit with kids, so who cares if I thought these were too
dry, too dense, and not flavourful enough?
