excerpt: "The most time-consuming part was skinning the nuts; blanched almonds can be purchased, but I\'ve never seen pistachios without skins. These spread quite a bit in the oven and will burn quickly so keep an eye on them. Even in airtight containers, the florentines\' edges lost their crunch after a day,"

These spread quite a bit in the oven and will burn quickly so keep an eye on them. Even in airtight containers, the florentines' edges lost their crunch after a day, probably from the moisture in the dried fruit. I skipped the white chocolate drizzle. <a href="http://shewhoeats.blogspot.com/2005/12/christmas-cookie-quartet-with-teas.html">Chika</a> made these too.
