This is a loaf that was a favourite at our house and one I'd make again!<br /><br />I was able to make it one day as follows: <b>08:00</b> make soaker using milk, cornmeal, large-flake rolled oats, cooked brown rice, ground flaxseeds, and wheat germ (instead of wheat bran); <b>13:00</b> make biga; <b>20:00</b> bake. The proofed bread rose quite nicely in the oven and formed a beautiful loaf shape, despite all the heavy whole grains. The texture is light, not dense at all. A winner.
