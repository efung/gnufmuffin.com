It was quite warm yesterday so the loaves proved quickly. As a result, the outer layer of dough was thick so I had to make a deeper slash to expose the cheese. While the flavours blend well together, they are quite subtle (I can't taste any onion or potato flavour). This was my first time making a potato bread but I'll make more because I always have a hard time using up spuds.
