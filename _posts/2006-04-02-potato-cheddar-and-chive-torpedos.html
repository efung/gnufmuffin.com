excerpt: "I am currently maintaining a whole wheat barm so I used that to make this bread, along with boiled red potatoes, a mix of chives and green onions, and Balderson Old Cheddar.

It was quite warm yesterday so the loaves proved quickly. As a result, the outer layer of dough was thick so I had to make a deeper slash to expose the cheese. While the flavours blend well together, they are quite subtle (I can't taste any onion or potato flavour). This was my first time making a potato bread but I'll make more because I always have a hard time using up spuds.
