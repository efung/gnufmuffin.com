excerpt: "While in Montreal for the high holidays, I had the opportunity to make delicious things using the bountiful fruits and vegetables in the Quebec markets at this time of year. This CI recipe is a cinch to make and is adaptable to other fruit including peaches, apples and pears. There\'s no pre-baking required"

This CI recipe is a cinch to make and is adaptable to other fruit including peaches, apples and pears. There's no pre-baking required (as required in their <a href="/2006/09/peach-crumble.html">peach crumble</a>) and it's very similar to the <a href="/2007/09/pear-crisps.html">pear crisp</a> which I love. The baked plums have a beautiful purple colour and the tart, soft plums contrast deliciously with the sweet-crunchy topping.
