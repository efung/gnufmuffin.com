Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes, it's not. For this fruit pie, I would have to say that it's not worth it. Here are the major steps:<br /><ul><li>Make special pie dough (not the foolproof vodka-based <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2007/11/cooks-illustrated-foolproof-pie-dough-recipe.html">recipe</a>) that is designed to be used as a lattice top. It has more water, and less fat, so as to be sturdy.</li><li>Macerate diced peaches, drain and reserve liquid.</li><li>Mash some of peaches to make a "paste" to act as a glue in the filling.</li><li>Cook reserved juices with pectin.</li><li>Weave lattice and bake.</li></ul>Now, I've been known to make cakes with four or five components, that involve several days of prep (for example, this <a href="/2011/08/fresh-fruit-charlotte.html">charlotte</a>), but I felt the fussiness of this recipe wasn't worth the end result.<br /><br />Slices of the pie did indeed hold their shape (which was the whole point of all the extra steps), and it did highlight the fresh peach flavour. But perhaps I didn't use the right peaches (this pie was made with white ones, from the Leslieville Farmers' Market), because it didn't have the fragrance or texture I wanted.<br /><br />In any case, even for a peach pie that is not a perfect 10, I devoured it greedily. We rented a house in the country with friends, and no one else was really eating the pie, so I probably ate more than &frac34; of it!
