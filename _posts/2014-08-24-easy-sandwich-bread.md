On Sunday evening, as I thought ahead to breakfast the next morning, I
realized we were out of bread (again). But instead of walking over to
the grocery store, I looked up a Cook's Illustrated recipe for a
superfast loaf (start to finish in under 2 hours) I recalled seeing 
from a few issues ago.

The key ideas for this recipe are to speed up the first rise by using
double the regular amount of yeast, and to hold off on the salt. High hydration
and bread flour provide structure since there is no kneading involved.
For the second rise, water and salt are added. Because the short time
frame doesn't allow much fermentation and flavour development, honey, butter and
whole wheat flour are used to enrich the dough. An egg wash and butter
glaze (both of which I skipped) gives the baked loaf additional colour and
flavour.

I made a mistake with the oven temperature and baked my loaf at
350&deg;F the whole time but it reached the target internal temperature
after an additional 10 minutes of baking time. My first impression after
taking the bread out of the oven was, “I should have used the egg wash”.
It looked very pale and pasty.

Not surprisingly, this bread turned out to be just like mass-produced white 
bread. It had a soft tender crumb, and not much taste. While some
may like this type of loaf and the time this recipe saves, I'm going to 
choose flavour over convenience.
