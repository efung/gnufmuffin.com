Notes: I left the <a title="a point of much debate between traditionalists and practicalists">pits</a> in as they're supposed to add a subtle almond flavour and help prevent bleeding (neither happened). Puffed up to the height of the dish but fell as it cooled. Good fruit/custard ratio.</p><br /><p class="outdent"><b>Pie</b>: Recipe from <span style="font-style: italic;">Wanda's Pie in the Sky</span>, by Wanda Beaver. Notes: Made with <a href="http://www.spectrumorganics.com/index.php?id=87#j236">Spectrum Organics Shortening</a>. Straight from the fridge, the shortening was very brittle and hard. Added a tablespoon of minute tapioca as the cherries were very juicy. Filling was a bit dry, could be sweeter too, but the oatmeal crumble is good.</p><br /><p class="outdent"><b>Ice cream</b>: <a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/000180.html">Recipe</a> inspired by Batch's Best recipe via 101cookbooks. Notes: I simmered both black and sour cherries with some sugar and cherry brandy until reduced and syrupy. I scalded the milk and cream and cooked the eggs as for a custard. Quantity is more than 1&frac12; quarts, too much for my machine. Lots of chunks makes this a tasty ice cream.</p>
