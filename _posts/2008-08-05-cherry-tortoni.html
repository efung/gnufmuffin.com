I also wanted to use up more egg whites so this recipe fit the bill, especially since it calls for amaretti. The latter are often found in stores carrying Italian goods, but they're not too hard to make; I used the Amaretti I recipe from Carol Field's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Italian Baker</span>. This frozen cake uses a no-bake crust made from vanilla wafers (I used PC Organic Animal Cookies), ground almonds and butter. I put a strip of acetate around my 9" false-bottom cake pan to ensure the cake would come out of the pan. The filling is a mix of whipped cream combined with a Swiss meringue into which is folded a cherry compote. I had neither Amaretto nor Marsala, so I substituted with Frangelico, almond extract and kirsch. This was an absolutely delicious frozen cake perfumed with the winning combination of cherry and almond, with nice crunch from nuts and cookies. I kept this in the freezer, taking it out when I wanted a piece, letting it soften in the fridge or at room temperature. It cuts beautifully with a hot knife. As Teena <a href="http://thegourmetproject.blogspot.com/2008/05/cherry-tortoni-page-864.html">noted</a>, the frozen chunks of cherry really mar the creamy texture of the filling.
