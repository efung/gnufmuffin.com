excerpt: "I enjoy the multigrain bread I make from time to time, but I'm always looking for new recipes. Cook's Illustrated's take on multigrain bread is to start with 7-grain cereal. As a substitute, I just ground up a 7-grain mix in the food processor so that it would absorb the hot water like prepared cereal"

Cook's Illustrated's take on multigrain bread is to start with 7-grain cereal. As a substitute, I just ground up a 7-grain mix in the food processor so that it would absorb the hot water like prepared cereal would. Aside from that, I followed the recipe as directed and produced some beautiful risen loaf. The flavour is wonderful and we've been eating it as breakfast toast.
