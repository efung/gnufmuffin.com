excerpt: "I followed the quantities for the test size (one 8&times;4\" loaf) and doubled it. To turn this cake into a tangerine one, I added the grated zest of one tangerine, plus the candied zest of an iyo tangerine I bought from Muji last fall. To prep the peel, which was a bit dry, I soaked it in a few tablespoons"

To turn this cake into a tangerine one, I added the grated zest of one tangerine, plus the candied zest of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangor">iyo tangerine</a> I bought from Muji last fall. To prep the peel, which was a bit dry, I soaked it in a few tablespoons of fresh tangerine juice, then added the softened peel to the batter while reserving the liquid.<br /><br />As they baked, it was clear that this recipe is scaled for the exact pan specified. Mine were 8.5 by 4.5" and the loaf came out way too squat. While the cakes were still warm, I reduced the reserved tangerine liquid and drizzled the syrup over top.<br /><br />A few things made this cake not as exciting as it could have been:<br /><ul><li>I used low-fat sour cream, so the flavour was not as rich<br /><li>I put the peel in the batter too early, so it got ground up too much<br /><li>The pan was too big, so the loaf was too squat and dried out<br /></ul><br />I have another package of tangerine peel, plus two yuzu ones, so I'll have to perfect my citrus-flavoured pound cake in the coming months.
