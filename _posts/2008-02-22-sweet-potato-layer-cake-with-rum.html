excerpt: "This is basically a carrot cake with mashed, boiled sweet potatoes replacing carrots. The layers were an inch thick each, making the whole cake over 4 inches high! I ran out of sugar (!!!) so had to make some substitutes for the frosting. Caramelizing turbinado sugar wasn\'t too much of a problem, but"

The layers were an inch thick each, making the whole cake over 4 inches high! I ran out of sugar (!!!) so had to make some substitutes for the frosting. Caramelizing turbinado sugar wasn't too much of a problem, but it's dark to begin with so you have to pay extra attention. I didn't have enough icing sugar so the frosting was very runny. In fact, it oozed out the sides of the cake rather than staying in between the layers. Even with the reduced icing sugar, it's very, very sweet. There's nothing that special about this cake, and I think that it's too big (or maybe I cut my slice too thickly). A variation of the basic recipe can be found <a href="http://www.newmorningtv.tv/recipe_SweetPotatoBundtCake.jsp">here</a>.
