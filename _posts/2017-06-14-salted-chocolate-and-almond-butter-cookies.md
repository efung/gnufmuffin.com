A summer backyard BBQ with neighbours calls for a crowd-pleasing dessert. I don't recall
how I came across this recipe, but the use of almond butter piqued my interest. The
cookies turned out to be winners, with a nice balance of sweet and salt.

The [recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/03/chocolate-almond-butter-cookies-recipe-miles-kirby-caravan-cooks-kitchen) is by Miles Kirby, published in The Guardian this month. I now
keep two kinds of peanut butter on hand: natural, for spreading on toast, and,
"regular", for baking projects which call for the kind with added sugar, salt,
and sometimes hydrogenated fats. I wasn't sure whether it mattered what kind to
use for this, but all I had was Kirkland natural almond butter from Costco.

I followed the ingredients and directions with a few modifications:
I used light brown sugar instead of muscovado, and, milk chocolate
buttons instead of dark. On the day of the BBQ, I made the dough
in the morning and let it chill in the fridge during the day. The
specified yield was one dozen, but each cookie would have been
enormous, so we made them a bit smaller.

These cookies puffed in the oven but didn't spread much, and become
super tender, likely due to the high fat content, and generous
amount of baking powder. I don't notice a strong almond flavour,
but did enjoy the salty-sweet interplay between the chocolate chunks
and the _fleur de sel_ crystals.
