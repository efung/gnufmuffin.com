excerpt: "Blech, these tasted untasty. The Bob's flour is very dark, and turned out some angry looking pancakes. I like trying new grains and recipes, but 100% buckwheat may be too much for me, or I haven't found the right recipe. There is no sweetener in the ingredients, so eat these with plenty of applesauce"

The Bob's flour is very dark, and turned out some angry looking pancakes. I like trying new grains and recipes, but 100% buckwheat may be too much for me, or I haven't found the right recipe. There is no sweetener in the ingredients, so eat these with plenty of applesauce or maple syrup. Mom said I should just think of them as healthy pancakes; I want to believe healthy and tasty aren't mutually exclusive!
