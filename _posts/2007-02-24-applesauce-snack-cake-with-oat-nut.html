The prep for this cake is time-consuming, as well as using a lot of <a title="more washing, bleh">bowls</a>. In a nod to healthiness, I added a few tablespoons of wheat germ to the batter. I like my streusel very fine, so I blitzed the oatmeal and nuts in the food processor. The cake was done after about 50 minutes. I was expecting an overwhelming apple flavour but that wasn't the case. Everyone enjoyed this very moist cake, not too sweet or heavy.
