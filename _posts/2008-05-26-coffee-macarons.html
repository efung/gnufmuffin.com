For the shells, I adapted the gingerbread recipe by replacing the spices with a half tablespoon each of cocoa powder and instant espresso powder, and reducing the amount of molasses. I made the buttercream recipe as written. The first two trays of macarons were too puffy and some of the cookies actually cracked; the last tray were larger and flatter. This is something I've noticed over and over again and must be caused by the warmth of my hands or as a result of additional mixing and stirring. Very assertive coffee flavour, highly recommended. I'm glad mine are turning out so successfully, as it seems from <a href="http://www.chowhound.com/topics/493580">this discussion</a> on Chowhound that the Toronto patisseries haven't been doing such a good job.
