Occasionally, my son and I do baking projects together, especially when the
finished product is something he wants to eat. Such was the case this weekend,
when he and I worked together to make this chocolate chunk cookie.

The [recipe](http://www.thefrenchberry.com/2012/04/chocolate-chunk-cookies.html)
is from Regan Daley's, [In The Sweet Kitchen](/tag/in-the-sweet-kitchen/). Because
his little sister was taking a nap, and we didn't want the mixer to wake her,
we took the noisy part outside.

We creamed butter, sugars and eggs, then folded in a flour mixture,
and we were done. The lengthiest step was hand-chopping the chocolate callets into
chunks. My son helped with cracking eggs, dumping ingredients into the mixer, 
and rolling and flattening the dough balls.

Unlike some recipes, like [this one](/2008/11/chocolate-chip-cookies.html) from 
Jacques Torres, Daley's recipe doesn't call for any refrigeration of the dough prior
to baking.

Definitely check the cookies at the minimum time: the secret to soft, chewy cookies is 
to not overbake them. Fresh out of the even, these were indeed soft and chewy. With a full 
pound of chocolate in the batter, every bite of cookie delivered satisfaction.

While this cookie doesn't have the complex and rich flavours of, say, the Cook's Illustrated
[one](/2009/06/perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html), it was fast and easy to make.
