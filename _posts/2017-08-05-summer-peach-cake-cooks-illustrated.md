It's the height of peach season in Ontario, with the 3L cardboard baskets 
appearing in markets everywhere. For a dinner we were invited to on Saturday, 
I contributed a summery cake made with, you guessed it, peaches.

The [recipe](http://www.whatmegansmaking.com/2011/08/summer-peach-cake.html) is from Cook's Illustrated
magazine, July 2011. Their technique of ensuring a non-gummy filling requires that you roast the fruit
in the oven. This drives off moisture, and causes them to shrink considerably. A sprinkle of panko (!)
further helps to absorb any syrupy residue.

As for the cake itself, the batter can be made completely by hand with a whisk, so it couldn't be 
much easier. Note that the layer of batter will be quite thin, just barely covering the roasted peaches.
I skipped the almond-sugar topping; a sweet, crunchy topping would distract from the fruit's 
sweet-tart contrast.

This cake was excellent: sturdy enough to hold up to the generous quantity of peach chunks, with a
pleasing amount of fruit in each forkful. The extra effort in preparing the peaches is worth it.
