One interesting aspect of the mash recipe is the use of <span style="font-style:italic;">altus</span> (soaked bread) which I made by taking cubes of the whole wheat mash bread and soaking it in water. Both the mash and soaker were very, very wet. Another problem was that the final dough calls for all of the mash but the weights didn't match up, so I may have used 50% too much mash. Since the dough was so wet, I ended up replacing the rye flour in the final dough with whole wheat, and also adding over an extra cup during machine kneading. I'm wondering what the problem is: whether my starter was not able to control the enzymes in the rye flour, the high proportion of mash or something else. I made a mess of slashing a wheat pattern in the top of the loaf and there was no oven spring at all. The loaves were dense and a little sour. Not very tasty, but will be excellent toasted with jam.
