At the Friday potluck, we invited friends over for dinner the next
night, and I half-jokingly said that I would make another dessert
for them. Of course, I take dessert very seriously and decided to
make the apple tart from the Nov/Dec 2014 issue of Cook's Illustrated.

I've made this type of tart
[before](/2007/10/french-apple-tart.html) and remember it being
excellent. The combination of an applesauce base and roasted apples on
top, with a simple crust supporting the whole thing satisfied my desire
for a dessert that would really feature the fruit.

First, I took McIntosh apples and turned them into applesauce. I not
only felt that it would be an acceptable substitute, but wanted to use 
the last of the farm-picked ones anyway. To add depth to the sauce, the
recipe also includes some apricot preserves (I could only find jam in
the supermarket), butter and a pinch of salt.

Making the crust was easy, as CI recommended just melting the butter,
making a dough that resembled Play-Doh and just patting it into the tin.
While this was certainly easy to make, it didn't bake up that uniformly,
but had patches and bumps here and there.

Partially cooking the apples for the topping was also straightforward,
and the key here is to avoid overcooking them, as they get roasted for
an additional half hour after assembly. Our tart got a little too
caramelized, and you really do need to check constantly when using
a broiler, as things can go from attractive to burnt in seconds.

Overall, I loved the crisp, buttery crust and the double apple filling.
Four adults and two children nearly finished the whole tart. The leftovers
slices didn't fare well the next day: the moisture from the
applesauce turned the crust mushy.
