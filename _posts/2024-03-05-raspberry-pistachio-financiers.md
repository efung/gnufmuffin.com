Using up [egg whites](/tag/eggwhites/) is a recurring issue when
making things like curds, ice creams, custards, etc. Financiers
are one way to use them up, but haven't been a regular in our household.
However, with the success of this batch, I may now have a go-to recipe
whenever we have a surplus.

The [recipe](https://duchessbakeshop.com/blogs/the-duchess-blog/a-mothers-day-treat-with-recipe) is from the _Duchess Bake Shop_ cookbook.
This is not a beginner's book: it caters towards experienced bakers,
with measurements in weights and volumes, and a few complicated creations
with multiple sub-recipes like the 
[Tart Montr√©al](/2020/04/tart-montreal-step-by-step.html).

But this financier is one of the easier recipes. Even if you don't have
the traditional shaped pan, you could use mini-muffin pans. I
have a pair of silicone molds, each with 7 large cavities, and I
can't recall that I've ever used them before!  With sky-high grocery
prices, I opted for blackberries on sale at the supermarket as a
substitute, but found reasonably priced raspberries the next day.

These turned out great, and taste _amazing_ when they're still warm. The
fruit makes them get moist and sticky in the next few days, so I'd
warm them in a toaster oven before serving. I also had some problems popping
them out even though I buttered and floured the mold. Definitely be
generous with the sprinkling of nuts. Next time, I'd use smaller pieces of
fruits to ensure they don't contribute too much moisture.
