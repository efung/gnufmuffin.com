In thinking about desserts for Passover this year, we wanted to be able
to make some things ahead of time. Way back in [April 2008](/2008/04/),
I spent a week making treats which I brought to Florida. I decided to 
make chocolates again as part of this year's dessert selection.

As it's a perennial favourite, I made [salted caramel](/2007/04/salted-caramel-chocolates.html) 
chocolates. But I also decided to adapt the [peanut butter crisp](/2013/10/peanut-butter-crisp-chocolates.html)
chocolates and try a slight variation, using cashews.

First, I ground a mix of regular and salted cashews with a few tablespoons of 
vegetable oil, to make a chunky cashew butter.

Next, I melted milk chocolate, combined it with the nut butter, and stirred in some crushed
Corn Flakes (I didn't have any feuilletine). I poured this mixture into a clingfilm-lined square
pan, and let it set up overnight.

Once it was firm, I used a ganache cutter to cut individual pieces out, and let them dry out a bit.

I tempered a 70% dark chocolate, and used it to dip the individual pieces, placing the dipped 
chocolates directly onto a transfer sheet. This was a lot simpler than cutting individual squares
to place on top.

The finished chocolates turned out pretty nicely. Many pieces had a lot of excess chocolate dripping
off of them, leading to a small pool of chocolate on the bottom, er, top. The cornflakes stayed crisp
(but not as crispy as feuilletine), and the slight saltiness of the nuts was a nice foil to the milk 
chocolate's sweetness. My only criticism was the thinness of the piece.

Note: This treat is _milchig_ due to the chocolate filling. Feuilletine is made of wheat, but, depending
on your traditions, corn [might be okay](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/04/23/475266363/beans-and-rice-for-passover-a-divisive-question-gets-the-rabbis-ok).
