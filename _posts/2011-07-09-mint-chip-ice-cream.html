excerpt: "The previous owners of our house must have planted mint in the backyard. Each year, I pick the plants right down to their roots but they keep coming back. This week, I harvested as many leaves as I could to make this ice cream. To maximize flavour, I let the washed, dried mint steep in cold cream overnight"

Each year, I pick the plants right down to their roots but they keep coming back. This week, I harvested as many leaves as I could to make this ice cream. To maximize flavour, I let the washed, dried mint steep in cold cream overnight before proceeding with heating the mixture and letting it infuse some more.<br /><br />Drizzling the melted chooclate onto the layers of freshly churned ice cream requires a little skill. You don't want big globs because they'll freeze into big, hard pieces, but you don't want thin wisps either as they don't deliver enough chocolate taste. Using a good quality chocolate is key here, as you can really notice the difference compared to the waxy, crayon-like pieces found in most mint chip ice creams.<br /><br />For fun, I also made a few chocolate leaves, by brushing melted chocolate onto the underside of a few pieces of mint. This also requires <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/probonobaker/sets/72157610669482636/">some skill</a>&nbsp;that I haven't developed yet. In the photo, I've served the ice cream in a new product I saw at Loblaws, <a href="http://loblawstores.ca/LCLOnline/products.jsp?brandId=4&amp;type=details&amp;tags=lclot52011&amp;productId=prod870037">waffle bowls</a>!
