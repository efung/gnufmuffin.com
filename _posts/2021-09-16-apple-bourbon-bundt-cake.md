Fall is on the horizon, and I've reluctantly stopped making ice creams,
and thinking more about warm, comforting desserts. While looking for an 
apple cake to end off a post Yom Kippur meal, I landed on a real
winner from Melissa Clark.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013937-apple-bourbon-bundt-cake)
can be found in New York Times Cooking. From the reviews, people mentioned
how much work it was, and how it stuck to the bundt pan. These reports
_did not_ deter me in the slightest. The "work" includes dicing candied
ginger and soaking it in some bourbon, grating a few apples, and
toasting and chopping pecans. Easy peasy.

To ensure the cake would release, I greased the mold heavily with butter,
sprayed it with oil for good measure, then used a heavy dusting of AP flour.
When it came time to invert the cake, it slid out perfectly. I followed the 
advice given by others, applying half the glaze to the bottom of the cake
while it was still in the pan, then the remainder after turning it out.

This is an unusual apple cake in that the apples totally melt into the
batter, as did the candied ginger. But each bite is moist and flavourful,
with the heady aromas of whiskey, lemon, apple, cinnamon and ginger.
It kept at room temperature for several days. Highly recommended.
