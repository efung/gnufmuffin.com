Around this time of year, they get a big harvest, too big for them to consume by themselves. So on a Saturday afternoon last week, while we were visiting, we harvested a big shopping bag full of small Rainier cherries. These weren't very big, nor were they very sweet, but I wouldn't call them sour cherries.<br /><br />At home, I used a pitter to pop out the kernel, and then used a food processor to chop up the cherries. I think the jam recipe in the box guarantees a good set, but I found it to be too thick to my taste. Also, I prefer bigger chunks of fruit, and more soft set. This was just an OK jam.
