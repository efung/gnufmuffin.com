We've been gorging on strawberries this summer. We didn't go on
any pick-your-own trips this year, just trips to the local fruit stands
or supermarkets. I've been trying different strawberry shortcake
recipes, and was disappointed in this one.

The [recipe](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2023/jun/07/ways-to-make-strawberries-even-tastier/) 
is by Melissa Clark, a veteran recipe developer, author, and media personality. 
To get the "double" strawberries in, she macerates diced berries to get rid of 
the liquid, then folds them into the dough. Unfortunately, the
dough was quite dry, and I didn't add any additional buttermilk to bind
the crumbs together.

While the shortcakes held together after baking, their texture was extremely
crumbly and a little dense, definitely not flaky or light. I didn't think the
extra fruit added much.
