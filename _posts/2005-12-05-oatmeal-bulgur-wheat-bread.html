I took it out of the bowl and kneaded it by hand. The dough seemed very dry and crumbly, and I had to split it into two pieces. It never became elastic and didn't pass the windowpane test. After almost two hours, it didn't double in volume, so after shaping into loaves, I put the pans into the fridge overnight. After baking, they still didn't rise very much. However, it turned out alright. The texture is dense but still pleasant, with sweetness from the oats and a little soft crunch from the bulgur.
