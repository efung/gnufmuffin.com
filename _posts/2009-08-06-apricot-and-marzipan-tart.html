excerpt: "The idea was to use a big 3L basket of apricots (plus a handful of raspberries and blackberries) to make a yummy tart, and to use up an old piece of almond paste. Unfortunately, this tart was a bit of a disappointment. The pat-in crust was simple, as was mixing sugar and cornstarch into the fruit. Making"

Unfortunately, this tart was a bit of a disappointment. The pat-in crust was simple, as was mixing sugar and cornstarch into the fruit. Making the crumble topping was also easy, as it's all done in the food processor. Several things contributed to a poor result. My apricots weren't quite ripe, so the fruit ended up firm and tart after baking, and the filling was gummy due to the use of cornstarch. Oh well.
