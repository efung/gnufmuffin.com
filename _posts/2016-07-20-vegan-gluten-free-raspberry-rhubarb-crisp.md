We're spending two weeks at two cottages this summer, in the
Haliburton region.  Yesterday afternoon, we passed a wonderful
afternoon at [Magnificent
Hill](https://www.facebook.com/Magnificent-Hill-178036108911013/), meeting
farm animals, collecting chicken eggs, picking raspberries, and
enjoying the outdoors. With the bounty we harvested, including a
box full of rhubarb, I turned some of it into a delicious crisp.

The friends we are staying with are avoiding dairy and gluten, so
I adapted this
[recipe](http://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-raspberry-rhubarb-crisp/)
from the Minimalist Baker. One look at the sugar in the filling and
I knew it was _way_ off: 1 to 3 tbsps for 4½ cups fruit? That couldn't
be right. The [sour cherry
pie](/2016/07/sour-cherry-pie-with-almond-crumble.html) had
three-quarters of a cup for about the same amount of fruit! I checked with a [Martha Stewart
recipe](http://www.marthastewart.com/316493/rhubarb-raspberry-crisp) for
rhubarb crisp, which called for ⅔ cup of sugar, which sounded way more reasonable.

For this crisp, I used a heaping 4 cups of rhubarb, chopped small,
2 cups of raspberries, ⅔ cup sugar, and the zest of a clementine. 
Neither recipe called for a thickener, which gave me pause, but I
stuck with the directions. As for the crisp topping, I used finely 
chopped almonds instead of pecans, and a margarine in place of butter.

This was a delicious dessert for the end of our day, one that everyone
found tart but comforting. The oatmeal was too chewy, picking up too
much of the liquid from the filling; maybe grinding some of it up, and 
making the nuts coarser, would fix that. Rhubarb isn't something
that I cook with a lot, but whenever I come into a large quantity,
it's nice to know there's a dessert to fall back on.
