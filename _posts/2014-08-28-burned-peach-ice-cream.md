Peaches have shown up in our breakfast (smoothies), dinner (salads),
snacks and desserts all week long. With the last few yellow peaches from
Sunday's market haul, I made a peach ice cream as part of an office
frozen dessert event.

One thing in Alton Brown's
[recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/burned-peach-ice-cream-recipe2.html)
that wasn't in my pantry was peach preserves.  Finding this ingredient
was not easy: supermarket shelves stocked many brands of apricot
jam, but no peach ones. I found several peach spreads mixed with
other fruit. In the end, I reluctantly bought a jar of golden peach
spread (St. Dalfour). I would have greatly preferred to buy an
Ontario product, but I didn't want to visit half a dozen stores to
get one.

When the ice cream base reached 170&deg;F, I noticed it had thickened
considerably, and had a curdled appearance. I'm not sure why that
happened, as there's no eggs, just dairy, sugar, salt, vanilla and 
peach spread. I skipped straining the mixture, as I wanted to keep 
the bits of peach in the final product.

Next, I halved the peaches, placed them on a baking sheet, and broiled
them in the oven. The fruit was juicy, so it took a while for the liquid
to evaporate before it started to blacken. I rotated the fruit a few times
to get black spots all over. Removing the skin meant losing the burnt
bits, but I opted to do it anyway.

With four large peaches diced into this ice cream, there was plenty of fruit 
in every delicious spoonful. My colleagues really liked it, as did I. Next 
time, I would try grilling the peaches to get more of a burnt and smoky 
flavour.
