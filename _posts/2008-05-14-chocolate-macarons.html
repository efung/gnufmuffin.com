The link above is part of a very long discussion on macaron making on eGullet, and I chose this particular recipe because it worked consistently for others. My food processor was in the dishwasher, so I just sieved the nut-sugar-cocoa mixture. As has happened to me in the past, the first tray of piped shells was evenly sized and baked up thickly. But the second batch spread out more on the pan and baked up thinner. Twelve minutes in a 350&deg;F oven made for perfectly baked cookies, crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside. After sandwiching them with a semisweet ganache, I put the macarons (about 20 from a double-batch of this recipe) in the fridge overnight. These were very tasty and they went very quickly at today's sale. I would also recommend this recipe, along with the one from David Lebovitz.
