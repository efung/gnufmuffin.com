excerpt: "I baked the cake in an 8\" tin for about 10 minutes longer than indicated. It turned out to be very sturdy indeed and was easy to slice, although there was some egginess and density in the very centre. After putting it all together, I was a little disappointed that the layers did not remain distinct."

It turned out to be very sturdy indeed and was easy to slice, although there was some egginess and density in the very centre. After putting it all together, I was a little disappointed that the layers did not remain distinct. Perhaps I could have reduced the liquid in the macerated strawberry syrup a bit further, or whipped the cream filling a bit less so it would be easier to spread. The cake leaves a little to be desired: it's sturdy for sure and stands up to the wet berries and cream, but it crumbles as if it was stale. The cream has a strong tangy cheese flavour that may not suit all tastes. I didn't use all of the berry puree and as a result, the fruit layer isn't very visible; I would use all of it next time. All in all, a pretty good cake.
