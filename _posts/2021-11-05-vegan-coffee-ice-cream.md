As there were a number of kids at our Friday night dinner, I decided
to make ice cream in addition to the [cake](/2021/11/dairy-free-chocolate-cake.html).
In keeping with the pareve meal, I turned to the [Van Leeuwen Cookbook](https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/product/van-leeuwen-cookbook/), which is my go-to source for vegan ice creams. 

My first choice was the cold brew Earl Grey one, but my son convinced
me to go with coffee instead. I had cashew milk in the fridge, and 
made the base using itâ€¦ before realizing that one guest had a 
particular nut allergy. I put that jar away in the basement fridge
for later.

Starting over, I remade the base using almond milk. Two tablespoons
of coffee powder sounded like a lot, but after churning, I was
disappointed that it was barely detectable. I've never found the
Van Leeuwen vegan base to be too strong (from the coconut oil and
coconut milk), but in this case, I think it overpowered the coffee.

Two days later, I took the cashew milk base back out.  Even after
sitting for 48 hours in the fridge, it didn't solidify, and
I only needed a whisk to loosen the mixture. I added an extra
tablespoon of instant espresso to it, and this time, the coffee 
flavour was more pronounced, but I still detected too much coconut.
Maybe instant espresso isn't the way to go here, and steeping fresh
ground coffee would be better.
