Our two weeks vacationing at cottages were split by a brief trip
back to Toronto, where we spent a night hosting our out-of-town
friends before they returned home.  Using more of the rhubarb we
brought back from [Magnificent
Hill](https://www.facebook.com/Magnificent-Hill-178036108911013/), we
made a quick syrup that evening, and enjoyed cold glasses of this
[rhubarb mint
mojito](http://www.canadianliving.com/food/recipe/rhubarb-mint-mojito).  We
also decided to delay going to the next cottage by a day, which
gave me an opportunity to make a jam.

The [recipe](http://news.nationalpost.com/life/food-drink/how-to-make-pickles-jams-and-hot-sauces-and-put-them-to-good-use-in-your-cooking) comes from a brand new cookbook from two local authors, called [Batch](http://www.wellpreserved.ca/batchcookbook/). They run a blog called Well Preserved, which I hadn't heard of, but
my wife saw their booth at the Leslieville Farmer's Market and thought I would like the
book.

To prepare the fruit, the directions call for dicing the rhubarb,
macerating it overnight with brown sugar, then roasting it in an
oven until the pieces brown. I let it go a bit too long, so some
of the pieces burned a little. The recipe, as printed in the book,
does not say what to do with the leftover syrup. I added it to
the jam mixture when simmering it. In my haste, I also forgot to
add the vanilla at the end.

The finished jam was nicely chunky, but didn't have a set texture.
I know that rhubarb does not have much pectin, and this recipe doesn't
call for any, but it turns out just fine. We brought one jar of
the finished jam with us to the second cottage.  I like the flavourings
contributed by the candied ginger, cloves, peppercorns and lemon
zest. To me, this condiment works well with roasted meats, like a
burger or pork chop, rather than as a spread on toast.
