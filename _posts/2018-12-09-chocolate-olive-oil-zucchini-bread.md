For our annual Hanukkah party, I always look for desserts made with [olive oil](/tag/olive-oil/).
With a dessert menu that already included an apple cake, banana bread, and hot churros, Dr. S
suggested something chocolatey. Flipping through a recent cookbook purchase led me to
a cake that checked all the boxes.

The [recipe](http://sevenspoons.net/blog/2011/8/2/the-means-to-the-end.html) is by Tara O'Brady,
from her [Seven Spoons](/tag/seven-spoons/) cookbook from a few years ago. It's made with
both AP and whole-wheat flour, and includes chocolate chunks and walnuts. The most time-consuming
part is preparing the squash. It's not mentioned in the version I linked above, but the
book mentions blotting the zucchini shreds between paper towels. For maximum dryness, I used a 
cheesecloth to wring out a substantial amount of liquid.

Predictably, this quick bread was a hit, especially with kids. It's moist and a little dense, and 
full of flavour. I gleefully told everyone it's even a little bit good for you, because of the
whole wheat flour.
