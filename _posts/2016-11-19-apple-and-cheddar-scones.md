A few weeks ago, I made an impulse purchase of three used cookbooks
from [ThriftBooks](http://www.thriftbooks.com/). The first volume
arrived this week, a book by Bill Yosses (former White House pastry
chef) and Melissa Clark, entitled [The Perfect
Finish](/tag/the-perfect-finish). For a change of pace at breakfast,
I tried making the apple and cheddar scones.

The [recipe](http://leitesculinaria.com/45846/recipes-apple-and-white-cheddar-scones.html)
incorporates a whole pound of sliced apples for just six scones. The fruit is baked briefly
to dry it out a bit, then mixed into the dough. There's not a lot of cheddar in the batter,
just enough to give a savoury contrast. I thought these scones were really, really good,
and made them twice in one week. Highly recommended.
