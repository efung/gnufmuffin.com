For an easy quick dessert for a Friday night dinner, I made a batch of
chocolate madeleines. There's much to love about these little cakes 
masquerading as cookies: buttery flavour, soft texture, enticing 
fresh-baked aroma. Anyone can make them, provided you have the molds.

The Pierre Herm√©
[recipe](https://lemonsandanchovies.com/2012/04/chocolate-madeleines/)
I used comes from his <i>Chocolate Desserts</i> cookbook, and is one of
the easiest. The batter can be made by hand (no mixer required) but does
require a long rest. 

My baked madeleines did not have the characteristic hump, unfortunately.
But they still tasted great: buttery, with a hint of lemon and a light
chocolate flavour. There was flour clinging to the ridges of the
baked cakes: likely too much butter used for greasing, and/or not
sufficiently tapping out the excess when flouring the tins.
