excerpt: "With the cornflake crunch left over from an earlier project, I made the cornflake cookies from the book, but substituted blueberries for marshmallows, as they are on my shortlist of Foods I Don\'t Eat. By now, the ingredients and procedure for a Milk Bar cookie are familiar. I made small scoops of dough,"

By now, the ingredients and procedure for a Milk Bar cookie are familiar. I made small scoops of dough, and had a yield of 21 cookies, but even though I took the cookies out at the 15-minute mark, they still came out too browned and crisp. The cornflake texture and flavour weren't as prominent as I would have liked: the <a href="/2013/11/corn-cookies.html">Corn Cookie</a> packs more corn punch, and the <a href="/2014/01/compost-cookies.html">Compost Cookie</a> offers more contrasts. Nevertheless, my tasters emptied the plate.
