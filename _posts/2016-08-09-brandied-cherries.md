After returning from our cottage vacation in July, I really hoped that
local sweet cherries would still be available. The farmer's markets didn't
have any, but the supermarket still did, so I bought five pounds worth,
with the intention of preserving them in liquor.

The
[recipe](http://sift.quinciple.com/recipes/cherry-top/) comes from 
[The Bar Book](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2014/i-wrote-a-book/), a
recent purchase to raise my mixology mastery. It's a technique-focused book, but
there are lots of interesting recipes in it. When I saw the brandied cherries
recipe, I promised myself that I would make it when we were back home. The first
step for us was to buy a cherry pitter, since our last one broke, and to buy
the two other items we didn't have in our pantry: juniper berries and brandy.

Because Dr. S isn't a fan of allspice, star anise nor cinnamon, my compromise
was to use half the quantities of these spices. I definitely wanted to include
them, though, as I liked the idea of subtle, warm, hard-to-identify flavours
in the finished cherries. Our cherries were a bit on the small side, but they
were relatively firm, and easy (though tedious) to pit.

I experienced [syphoning](http://www.wellpreserved.ca/home-canning-101-what-is-syphoning/) 
for the first time while canning these cherries: the syrup from the jars 
leaked out after I removed them from the hot water. To avoid the risk
of spoilage, the next day, I pried open the lids, and re-processed 
the contents. This time, I made sure to leave a full Â½" of headroom,
and to take out the jars promptly.

Cherries are a garnish in a number of classic cocktails, and I look forward
to enjoying them in a drink, as well as in applications like Black Forest Cake
and other desserts. We also saved all of the leftover syrup, as a tablespoon
mixed with sparkling water on ice is dynamite.
