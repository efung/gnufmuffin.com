Cold weather season means soup season, and I love that Cantonese
cuisine has sweet dessert soups ([tong sui](/tag/tong-sui/)). I couldn't
resist buying a bulk bag of Kadoya black sesame seeds at the grocery,
and I'm glad I did, because I've been making batch after batch of
this deeply satisfying dessert.

The [recipe](https://www.wokandkin.com/black-sesame-soup/#recipe) is fairly
easy, but does require a good blender. My sesame seeds were already
toasted, but I tossed them in a hot frying pan anyway until the
white seeds started to turn golden. One minute in a Vitamix was 
enough to thoroughly puree the seeds, glutinous rice flour, and 
water. But you could also go another minute longer if you want a finer
texture.

The initial colour of the mixture is a medium gray, perhaps a bit 
unsettling if you've never worked with black sesame before. But as the
rice flour cooks and thickens, and after the sugar is added,
the colour deepens further to a darker gray, almost black.

After making this three times, I've learned a few things: you can
use either regular rice flour or glutinous rice flour instead of
soaking and grinding grains of rice. You can also reduce the water
somewhat for a thicker texture.

I love black sesame paste: it reminds me of childhood.
The warmth, the nuttiness, the sweetness, and the uncommon colour
all appeal to me. I've even convinced my family that it's
high in protein so could be a filling breakfast!
