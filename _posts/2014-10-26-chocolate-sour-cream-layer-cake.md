For a friend celebrating her birthday this past week, we offered
to make a dessert. Her parameters to me were that it be a
chocolate cake. To keep things simple, we decided on a frosted layer
cake from one of Alice Medrich's books.

The Chocolate Sour Cream Layer Cake recipe I used comes from her
book <i>Chocolate Holidays</i> but the same
[recipe](http://homecooking.about.com/od/cakerecipes/r/blc44.htm)
appeared in one of her earlier volumes. The recipe calls for Dutched
cocoa powder (which Fry's Cocoa is), but I bought some in bulk from
a baking supply store, and it was much darker in colour, so who
knows.

Sour cream is used both in the cake and the frosting. The latter
is made simply from a bit of instant espresso, melted chocolate and
sour cream.  It really does need to be used right away, as it firms
up quickly. The yield is a bit stingy though. Cream/icing/frosting
is usually the best part of cake!

This was pretty good, uncomplicated but delicious. The cake itself
was fine-crumbed and a little dense, and the frosting was chocolatey
and tangy.
