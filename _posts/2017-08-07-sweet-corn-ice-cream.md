Corn is a "vegetable" that is pretty sweet, so it makes sense (in my mind) to
try dessert applications of it. After getting a baker's dozen ears of corn
at the Saturday farmer's market, I was all set to makeâ€¦ ice cream!

This weekend was [not the first time](/2014/08/sweet-corn-ice-cream-with-blueberry.html) 
that I've made corn ice cream. But I wanted to try the version described in 
the Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream cookbook. The first step was to strip
the kernels off four cobs of corn, and infuse the sweetened cream/milk mixture 
with the leftover cobs. I put everything into the fridge at this point,
to accommodate my schedule.

Later in the day, I re-warmed the infused cream (removing the cobs at this point)
and made the custard. To halt the cooking immediately, I dumped the chilled
corn kernels into the heated mixture, before pureeing and straining it.

The finished ice cream had a mild, raw corn flavour, with a pale
yellow colour. I'm on the fence about this one: while I welcome the idea
of a corn ice cream, I'm not sure how to improve this particular example. 
Try cooking the corn first? Play with the sugar or salt content? Use these
in an ice cream sandwich made with [corn cookies](/2013/11/corn-cookies.html)?
