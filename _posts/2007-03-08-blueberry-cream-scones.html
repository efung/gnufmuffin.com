excerpt: "I used frozen blueberries to make these scones (more leftover ingredients: 35% cream). As I was stirring this gluten-free dough together, I was thinking about how you don\'t have to worry about overmixing (which causes toughness) since there\'s no gluten to be formed. I ended up with 15 2&frac12;\" scones;"
