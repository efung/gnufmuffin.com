With the rest of the heavy cream I had on hand, I made this
coffee, chocolate, and nut ice cream that was well worth the effort.
The combination is classic: you may have tried this at Baskin Robbins,
where they call it [Jamoca Almond Fudge](http://www.baskinrobbins.ca/product-profile/jamoca-almond-fudge/).

The recipe comes from the Van Leeuwen ice cream book. I had no idea
that their empire is so big now, that they've raised [18.7 million USD](https://ny.eater.com/2020/2/27/21155887/van-leeuwen-ice-cream-18-7-million-funding-nyc) and have more than 20 retail locations.
I've never had any of their products in person, but have been
really impressed with the recipes in the book.

The base uses 6 egg yolks, cocoa powder, and 20g freeze dried coffee. I only
had instant espresso (the Medaglia dâ€™Oro stuff) and used a total of 15g, as it seemed 
like a lot. The final product had lots of java flavour with this amount. For the
chocolate ripple (or ribbon, as Baskin Robbins calls it), you make a batch
of hot fudge sauce (corn syrup, cocoa powder, unsweetened chocolate, sugar, water).
This, plus slivered almonds, are stirred into the freshly churned ice cream base.

The verdict? A definite winner, and one that we'll add to our roster. It's got
a wonderful balance of bitter and sweet, and textural interest from the chewy 
chocolate sauce and crunchy nuts.
