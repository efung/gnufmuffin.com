excerpt: "Another item for Heart &amp; Stroke fundraising. I had some leftover sour cream and was pleased to find this recipe which uses it in both the cake and icing. I didn\'t know what a &ldquo;sandwich tin&rdquo; was so I just used two 8\" round cake tins. The cake is quite tender so be careful when picking"

I had some leftover sour cream and was pleased to find this recipe which uses it in both the cake and icing. I didn't know what a &ldquo;sandwich tin&rdquo; was so I just used two 8" round cake tins. The cake is quite tender so be careful when picking up the layers. When combining the icing sugar into the chocolate mixture, there were tiny little lumps of icing sugar which I got rid of using a hand blender. Tasting notes later.<br /><br />(Note that the recipe link uses the converted volume measurements from the US version of the book; my copy uses the original recipe with Metric weights.)
