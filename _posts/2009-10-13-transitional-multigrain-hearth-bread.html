excerpt: "In the soaker for this bread, I used blue cornmeal, a little kamut flour, some golden flaxseeds ground in a suribachi plus a few other whole grains as specified in the recipe. Both the soaker and the biga went into the fridge for several days. I omitted sesame seeds from the final dough, but did use"

Both the soaker and the <i>biga</i> went into the fridge for several days. I omitted sesame seeds from the final dough, but did use toasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds. To get a nice crisp bottom crust, I placed the risen loaf on a preheated pizza stone in my regular oven. Despite following all these tips for making a complex, delicious whole-grain bread, I didn't like this one. It had that &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; mouth-feel, too coarse and crumbly. I used it for sandwiches and as breakfast toast, but didn't really enjoy it.
