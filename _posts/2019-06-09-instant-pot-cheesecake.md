I admit I was a skeptic about the Instant Pot: why would we need another mass-market
appliance, when we already had a stovetop pressure cooker? When I already make perfect 
rice in a pot? When we also own a slow cooker? Now, I am a convert: the electric,
multi-cooker is easy-to-use and versatile. I was most impressed by this cheesecake
that came out of it!

Unfortunately, I totally forgot which recipe I found from the Internet. There was 
definitely a graham crumb crust. But I don't even remember whether the recipe included
sour cream, or yogurt, or none of those. I did recall that I used a small canning rack
to elevate the 6" non-stick springform I baked this in.

What I do remember was that the cheesecake baked beautifully, with a uniform consistency
throughout, without any cracks on top. I will definitely try adapting other cheesecake
recipes for the Instant Pot, perhaps some of the dessert in _The Sweet Spot_, many of
which are steamed sweets.
