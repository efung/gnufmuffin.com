Another day, another Milk Bar dessert. I bought four kinds of citrus at the supermarket 
last week, including a bag of grapefruit from Texas. When I looked over this Milk Bar 
recipe, with its salty cracker crust, and two-layer filling, I was too intrigued to pass 
it up.

The [recipe](https://the-cooking-of-joy.blogspot.ca/2012/11/grapefruit-pie.html) comes from
Momofuku Milk Bar. For the grapefruit curd, I took several shortcuts that completely avoided
using a blender. Instead of blending the passion fruit pur√©e, sugar, and egg, I just 
whisked everything together in the saucepan. And I put the butter, bloomed gelatin,
and salt in a tall, narrow container, and used a hand blender to combine everything
into a smooth curd. As I was supreming and warming the grapefruit, it released a lot of
juice, which I strained, and did not incorporate into the curd.

For the sweetened condensed grapefruit, the process was even easier, just stirring
everything together. I didn't use pasteurized juice from a carton, but made 
fresh-squeezed instead. I ensured that the kosher salt and large citric acid crystals 
were completely dissolved in the juice, before combining in the condensed milk.

In the afternoon, after going to 7-Eleven for a box of Ritz, I made the crust. My son
had a fun time crushing the crackers into smaller pieces. The mixture was very crumbly,
and it was difficult to have it adhere to the sides of the pie plate. I didn't have a 10"
disposable one, so just used a standard 9" one.

Since I used a full sheet of gelatin (I didn't want a repeat of the loose panna cotta from earlier
this week), the curd firmed up considerably in the fridge. I used a spoon to break it up and distribute
it evenly in the crust. I didn't need the full amount for the 9" pie plate, nor did I need to
freeze this layer first. The condensed milk mixture was spreadable, and I used the full amount to top the pie.
In total, I froze the assembled pie for about two hours before serving.

First impressions of this pie weren't positive: the strong, buttery scent of the condensed milk
was off-putting to me, and the description alone turned off several people I had dinner with. 
But on tasting, the overall combination of flavours won over everyone, myself included. The
sweet-salty-sour taste balance is perfect, as is the crunchy-smooth texture pairing. I would
have wanted a second slice to sample tonight, but the hosts kept the leftovers for themselves!
