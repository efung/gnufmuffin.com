Sometimes, homemade is best. And sometimes, homemade just isn't possible.
That pretty much sums up my experiment this week to create my own
ube extract.

Ube is a purple yam grown in the Philippines (more in this Canadian
Grocer [article](https://canadiangrocer.com/four-things-know-about-ube)).
And, as an extract, it was responsible for the vibrant colour of
the [hamantaschen](/2022/03/ube-hamantaschen.html) I made. However,
I thought I could extract the colour myself, by cooking the tuber 
and concentrating any exuded liquid. Unfortunately, cooking
a package of frozen _khoai má»¡_ (the Vietnamese term for ube), 
didn't get me far: the starchy mass **absorbed** any water I tried 
to add to coax the colour to come out. 

So, what to do with ube that's already been grated and cooked? Why,
making buns of course! The [recipe](https://thewoksoflife.com/ube-buns/#recipe)
I used called for mashing freshly cooked ube, so I was already a step 
ahead!

The bun is made from an enriched, easy-to-roll milk bread dough.
In addition to the mashed ube, the filling is enriched
with coconut oil (for flavour), as well as sugar and butter.
To make the interior swirl, each dough ball is flattened, coated
with the purple spread, then roll up like a cigar. A very fun
and satisfying process.

During the final proof and in the oven, each bun expanded into its
neighbours. But they baked into a beautiful golden shine. I skipped
the post-bake sugar glaze. With their inviting appearance,
these would be fantastic in a breakfast buffet! The ube's flavour was
reminiscent of taro, and the coconut aroma reminded me of 
Hong Kong style [cocktail buns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_bun).

I would change the ratio of bread flour to cake flour next time,
as I found the bun to be a little too chewy. The filling was too
coarse, as the grated yam didn't break down, so I would probably
cook the ube longer and puree it in the food processor.
