The vendor said they were from Sudbury, and I walked away with a 1.5L basket which cost $22. That's a steep price for berries but the wild ones pack so much more flavour (and less water) than their cultivated cousins. I decided to try the pie from the current issue of CI which features the secret ingredient of grated apple whose pectin is supposed to help keep the filling from being runny. I made their foolproof pie dough with 100% butter, replacing the specified vegetable shortening. (The tub of lard in my fridge doesn't get much use these days.) Grinding the tapioca in my grinder left a faint coffee aroma that wasn't detectable in the pie. Unfortunately, the pie didn't set firmly, a specific goal of this recipe. Perhaps I needed to use a bit more tapioca? Or was it because I was short about a half cup of berries? Or I need to use a bit more apple? The pie is divine anyway.
