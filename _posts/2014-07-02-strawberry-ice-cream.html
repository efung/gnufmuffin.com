After gorging on several quarts, plain and with whipped cream, it was time to use them in a few dessert applications.<br /><br />For Canada Day, we had my family over for dinner, and I was excited to make this ice cream. Of course, it wasn't as easy as stirring in some strawberries into a vanilla ice cream. You need to macerate the berries, cook the custard, strain the strawberry juice and mix it into the custard, then churn the ice cream and add the berries at the end. It sounds like a lot of work, but believe me: <b>it's worth it</b>.<br /><br />This is a very delicious ice cream: the texture is smooth, creamy and rich, the colour is a pleasing shade of pink, and the flavour is extremely fragrant, with delicious bits of strawberries in every spoonful.
