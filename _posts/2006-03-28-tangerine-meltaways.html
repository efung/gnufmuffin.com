I overworked the dough so the cookies weren't light and I sliced them too thick. After baking for the prescribed time, they were still wet in the centre so I flipped them and put them back into the oven. Then when I made the frosting, there were lumps in the icing sugar. Still, the tangerine zest and juice pack quite a citrus-y tang.
