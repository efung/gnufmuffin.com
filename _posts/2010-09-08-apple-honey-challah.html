excerpt: "I made this for Rosh Hashanah this year, working in my brother-in-law's kitchen in Montreal. This is a very rich bread, full of butter and honey. In fact, there's even a honey butter glaze that's applied both before and after baking. Of course, it was received extremely well. Would definitely make"

This is a very rich bread, full of butter and honey. In fact, there's even a honey butter glaze that's applied both before and after baking. Of course, it was received extremely well. Would definitely make this again, but for special occasions only, not as a Shabbat regular.
