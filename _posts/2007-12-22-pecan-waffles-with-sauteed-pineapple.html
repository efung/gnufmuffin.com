excerpt: "I subbed a bit of gluten-free flours in place of the all-purpose to use them up. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written with great results. Overnight refrigeration didn't make the yeasted batter rise too much. We didn't take it out of the fridge to get the batter up to room temperature, but that"

Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written with great results. Overnight refrigeration didn't make the yeasted batter rise too much. We didn't take it out of the fridge to get the batter up to room temperature, but that didn't affect the waffles. The nutty flavour is great and the vanilla-pineapple accompaniment is yummy too. Highly recommended.
