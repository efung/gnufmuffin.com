excerpt: "This cake is simple enough that I was able to make it on a weeknight evening in under an hour, plus baking time. I only had 1 cup of sour cream, so I used &frac12; cup of half-and-half cream, and compensated for the additional moisture with more flour. For the topping, I used walnuts, as I had no pecans."

I only had 1 cup of sour cream, so I used &frac12; cup of half-and-half cream, and compensated for the additional moisture with more flour. For the topping, I used walnuts, as I had no pecans. One interesting feature of this recipe is that the streusel mixture in the middle is different than the one on top. Baking time was about 80 minutes, <a title="maybe due to frozen blueberries?">way more</a> than the recipe (I covered the cake after 1 hour). Be careful when inverting it out of the tube pan: the topping is loose and flies everywhere. This is a great breakfast treat, with satisfying amounts of streusel and a hearty cake to match.
