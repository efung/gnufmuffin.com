Continuing my exploration of Dana Cree's ice cream book, we hosted a small dinner
for a few parents from my son's class that we're close with. To make an interesting
flavour of ice cream, I turned towards the plants growing in our indoor garden.

The [Click & Grow](https://ca.clickandgrow.com/) was a gift from my wife a few years
ago. Recently, I restocked the seed pods and bought a mix of basils: regular (Genovese),
cinnamon, and Thai. When I read the headnote of the cinnamon basil ice cream
[recipe](https://seattlemag.com/eat-drink/recipe-week-cinnamon-basil-ice-cream/)
in the book, [Hello, My Name Is Ice Cream](https://www.hellomynameisicecream.com/),
I realized that the author calls for cinnamon basil if you can get it, with a 
substitute being regular basil and a cinnamon stick.

Since I didn't have 25g of cinnamon basil, I decided to experiment with a leafy blend
from all three varieties, supplemented by _another_ regular basil
plant I have growing in a windowsill. Per Cree's instructions, I
also included the stems. The suggested infusion time was short,
only 30 minutes (I did 60). Again, I used
tapioca starch as the texture agent.

This ice cream is ðŸ”¥. The flavour was not immediately identifiable to most of 
the tasters, and hinted at something vegetal. It was addictive though, with
everyone coming back for more. I really liked this ice cream. It bounces between
savoury and sweet in your mind. Highly recommended.
