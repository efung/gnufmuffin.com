For birthdays around here, my go-to cupcake recipe is one I've been making 
[for the last 10 years](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2013/05/ultimate-chocolate-cupcakes-revisited.html), 
namely, the Cook's Illustrated "ultimate" chocolate cupcake. This year, my daughter
and I brainstormed and researched, to come up with her ideal birthday dessert.

What we ended up with, was the following:

- A chocolate cupcake
- Frosted with raspberry ganache, piped with a star tip
- Topped with a fresh raspberry
- Accompanied by mango and raspberry sorbets

I started by making the cupcakes (without the ganache filling), so that they could cool. I used
foil-lined paper cups, so the design would still be visible after baking. Next, I made the
two sorbets, following recipes from the Van Leeuwen ice cream book. The mango one was 
straightforward, and I made it using thawed, frozen fruit. For the raspberry one, I used
fresh berries, pureed, then sieved to removed seeds. A very laborious process. Oh, and
the two recipes used two _different_ types of simple syrup (one involved boiling, to
super saturate the solution).

But the real eye-opener here, was the raspberry ganache, an idea from Sherry Yard's
_The Secrets of Baking_. Instead of using cream, her recipe is
like a [water ganache](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2019/02/baked-ricotta-and-hazelnut-cheesecakes.html),
using raspberry puree as the liquid. This resulted in a subtly flavoured ganache, not quite
as intense as the [passion fruit chocolate](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2020/01/passion-fruit-chocolates.html).
I love the idea of flavoured ganache, so next time, I'll try reducing the raspberry puree
by at least a half.
