excerpt: "Everyone is talking about this new ice cream book and some of the flavours do sound interesting, but I was looking for a frozen yogurt recipe and found this one. You can barely call it a recipe as it only has three ingredients: yogurt, sugar and vanilla extract. The mixture was very runny after 20 minutes"

You can barely call it a recipe as it only has three ingredients: <a href="http://www.organicmeadow.com/opy.sz?cid=51#mid">yogurt</a>, sugar and vanilla extract. The mixture was very runny after 20 minutes in the ice cream machine, but it became pretty solid after a night in the freezer. It's not a bad dessert, not very rich as to be expected, tangy and scented with vanilla.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update</span>: I just realized the <a href="http://dailyunadventures.blogspot.com/2007/07/vanilla-frozen-yogurt.html">original</a> recipe I linked to omitted the crucial step of draining the yogurt. That might account for the watery mixture and hard consistency after freezing.
