When you have a lot of apples, it's time to make apple pie. Or, so
said my 5-year old son. With only one frozen pie dough in my freezer,
I started thinking about a crumble topping, but found this Cook's
Illustrated recipe instead: a pie assembled in a skillet, and
requiring less than half an hour in the oven.

This [recipe](http://www.tinyfarmhouse.com/2008/11/the-pandowdy-must-wait/)
comes from the September 2008 issue of Cook's Illustrated. It's an
adaptation of a _pandowdy_, whatever that is. Since I only had one
disc of pie dough in the freezer, this was the perfect recipe, since
it doesn't use a bottom crust.

I used mostly Pink Lady apples. This is a new variety to me,
and I was really pleased with their flavour and firmness. After
caramelizing the slices, I stirred in a slurry made with cider,
maple syrup and cornstarch. The rolled-out crust went on top, 
slashed into large pieces to allow steam to escape.

After only 20 minutes in a 500Â°F oven, the top was nicely browned
and I could hear the filling bubbling. This bottomless pie was fantastic:
quick to prepare and just as tasty as a double-crust pie. I didn't
add any cinnamon (it's an optional ingredient in the recipe) so the
sweet-tart apples really had centre stage.
