We have a very active parent community at our kids' school. At a
recent party for the adults, I wanted to make something that would
be easy to eat (without utensils), used the remaining apples we had
from apple picking, and also be something not too pedestrian.
This "invisible" cake checked all the boxes.

I had never heard of this dessert before, but apparently, 
_gâteau invisible aux pommes_ is popular in France. It's
similar to a [clafouti](/tag/clafouti/) in that the fruit
is bound together with a batter that's somewhere between
custard and cake. Looking in my archives, it sounds similar
to these [custardy apple squares](/2016/11/custardy-apple-squares.html).

What makes it "invisible" is that the thinly sliced apples 
nearly disappear into the batter after baking. 
The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/gateau-invisible) I used
puts a Japanese spin on it, by incorporating white miso into the
batter, and an optional miso caramel sauce.

The mix of apples I used included many, very small Galas. Combined
with using a too-thin setting on the adjustable slicer on my food
processor, there were a LOT of apple slices to shingle into the
loaf pan. The instructions are specific on this point so as to
make the cooked slices have nice, even layers. But it was extremely
labour intensive for my daughter and I. We ended up just dumping 
most of the apples in the middle, and placing the flat sides of apple
flush with the edges.

I really enjoyed this cake. Right out of the even, the slices
were a bit wet. But the tender apple and the hint of miso made it
very satisfying. My daughter tasted banana bread flavours! An
unusual cake. I would definitely make this again, but using larger
apples, and slightly thicker slices to make assembly easier.
