Many substitutes: ground quick-cooking oats instead of oat flour, gluten-free flour instead of all-purpose (incorporating even more whole grains!), apple liqueur instead of apple juice concentrate, yogurt/milk instead of buttermilk, fresh apple instead of dried. Despite all of these changes, the scones turned out wonderfully. They're a little coarse due to the ground oats, but have good apple flavour. Eaten while warm, they had a strange odour (was it the cultured butter?) and I found they tasted better when they were at room temperature.
