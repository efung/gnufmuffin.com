We've been eating a lot of toast for breakfast recently, so it was time
to restock the freezer with some baked goods. I was surprised to find
out that I'd never tried these muffins before. And while they were
unmistakably full of oatmeal, sometimes, you can have too much of a good
thing.

The [recipe](http://www.madebymichellec.com/?p=4141) is courtesy of
Cook's Illustrated. It made more sense to me to make the muffin batter
first, rather than the topping, since the former needs to rest for 20
minutes. After I fried (yes, really) the old-fashioned oats in butter
until they smelled like popcorn, I let the pan cool while assembling the
other ingredients. The completed batter is quite liquid, but does 
thicken upon resting. During this time, I made the topping, using 
walnuts instead of pecans.

I sprayed a 12-cup tin with PAM, and then dusted it with flour. The
batter completely filled the cups and then some. To be safe, I placed
the tin on a baking sheet to catch any spills. I needed 25 minutes 
to fully bake these muffins.

These muffins were pretty lacklustre. I found the taste to be a little
one-dimensional, maybe there's too _much_ oatmeal (2 full cups in the 
batter). Or maybe browning the oatmeal in butter brings out some
undesirable flavours. Or maybe my “whisk folding” technique needs some
work to make a more tender product. In any case, when the topping is 
the best part of the muffin, you know it's not a good sign. I'd be 
willing to give this recipe another trial, but only because I believe
in CI's process.
