excerpt: "Made with yellow pattypan zucchini. Original recipe calls for pecans. Very dense and starchy, like a pudding. The protein comes from soy protein powder (different from soy flour!), which I bought at a health food store. Katzen suggests the &ldquo;biscotti treatment&rdquo;: slicing the bread then toasting"

Original recipe calls for pecans. Very dense and starchy, like a pudding. The protein comes from soy protein powder (different from soy flour!), which I bought at a health food store. Katzen suggests the &ldquo;biscotti treatment&rdquo;: slicing the bread then toasting it. Much better this way.
