I followed the recipe as written, using candied ginger puree from <a href="http://www.gingerpeople.com/">The Ginger People</a>. Being short on time, I only chilled the dough for about 30 minutes. When the first tray of cookies came out of the oven, I noticed they were very soft and pale, so the next few trays got extra time. In between batches, I realized that Lisa had written about this problem in her post (it's the recipe link above). I prefer a drier, crispier cookie and ended up baking the remaining trays for about 15 minutes each. The yield for me was almost 4 dozen. If you like ginger (and raisins), these cookies fit the bill.
