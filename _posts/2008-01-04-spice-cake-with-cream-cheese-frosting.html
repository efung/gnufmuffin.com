excerpt: "I was looking for a way to use up the rest of the buttercream, when I saw this recipe from the current issue of CI. The spice mixture is bloomed in browned butter which is supposed to bring out their flavours; I ran out of cinnamon (!) so I ground up a piece of cinnamon bark along with the allspice berries"

The spice mixture is bloomed in browned butter which is supposed to bring out their flavours; I ran out of cinnamon (!) so I ground up a piece of cinnamon bark along with the allspice berries (the rest of the spices were already ground). My stand mixer bowl was already used, so I tried making the cake using a handmixer with mixed (ha ha) results. It was difficult to cream the butter-sugar mixture plus I had to stir in the flour by hand. In the end, the cake had a few lumps and didn't have too strong of a spice flavour. For the frosting, I took the remaining Italian meringue buttercream and whipped in a block of cream cheese. The resulting icing was a bit lumpy with bits of cheese, and also began to split (perhaps too many refrigeration-thaw cycles). However, it was received with a few positive comments, and the cake was moist and light, a delicious snack or breakfast.
