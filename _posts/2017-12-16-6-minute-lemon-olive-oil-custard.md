While searching the Interweb for olive oil gelato recipes, I came across
this dairy-free custard recipe made completely in a high-speed blender.
Not only was this a novel technique, I was obsessed with how good it 
tasted. Imagine a sweet, lemony mayonnaise that livens up slices of 
cake, toast, or anything it's spread on.

The magic of this [recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/21323-caroline-j-beck-s-6-minute-meyer-lemon-olive-oil-custard)
is in using the heat generated by the blades of the blender. Instead of carefully
whisking over a bain-marie, straining to remove any bits of scrambled egg, you
dump everything in the container and let the machine do all the work.

I used regular lemons, so I can only imagine how much better and more complex the
flavour would have been with Meyer lemons. This recipe was an outstanding discovery,
and I'm excited to experiment with different kinds of citrus and varieties of olive 
oil. It's also a useful recipe to know, for those times when you need to prepare a 
dessert without any dairy.
