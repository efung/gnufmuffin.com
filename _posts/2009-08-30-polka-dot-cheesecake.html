We have a lot of bottles of the coffee-flavoured liqueur, but I wasn't satisfied with any of the recipes I found. Then, I stumbled upon this recipe on Saveur and an idea brewed in my head. What about adding instant espresso powder and Kahlua to the chocolate portion? Making this cheesecake was easy, but I didn't need the full two cups of the chocolate batter to make the polka dots. I think one and a half cups would be plenty for next time. While baking, the cake rose to the full height of my 3" pan, but fell as it cooled. It froze perfectly (as most cheesecakes do) and was instantly devoured by all the guests. Sigh, I'll have to make another one some other time.
