More historical information can be found in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortcake">Wikipedia article</a>, which also notes that June 14th is Strawberry Shortcake Day!<br /><br />Anyone can make this recipe, it's easy enough to do on a weeknight after dinner. I started by cutting and macerating the berries, then moved onto the shortcake dough. The bits of grated butter were small enough that the pastry cutter didn't really do much. I used a mix of heavy cream and milk as a substitute for half-and-half. There seems to be an extra ingredient, the 1 tbsp of half-and-half. Perhaps it's meant to be mixed into the egg white to make a wash for the biscuits?<br /><br />Once baked, assembly is a snap: split the shortcakes in half, spoon a generous amount of juicy berries and whipped cream over top, then top with the other biscuit. Let it rest for a few minutes so the juices soften the bottom cake. A perfect summer dessert1
