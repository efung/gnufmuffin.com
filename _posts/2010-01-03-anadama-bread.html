excerpt: "I read recently that a signature Reinhart recipe technique is soaking grains, and sure enough, this cornmeal-based bread requires an overnight soak of the coarse cornmeal.

I've made it before many years ago, and remember that it makes excellent toast. The large quantity of molasses gives this bread a distinctive taste and colour. Tackiness is a quality of the kneaded bread dough, but it will eventually become easier to handle. I ended up with three loaves: one 8&times;4", and two 8&frac12;&times;4&frac12;" ones. A nice everyday bread, with a tasty cornmeal crunch.
