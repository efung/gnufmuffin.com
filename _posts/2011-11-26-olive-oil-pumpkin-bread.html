Using olive oil in baked quick breads is nothing to me, but I didn't have any non-EVOO so I used sunflower seed oil instead. The squash I had was large, so instead of a cup of canned pumpkin, I made a triple batch with fresh squash. I did not leave out any of the exuded liquid. To keep it from being too cake-like, I cut both sugars by about a third. This was an excellent bread, moist and tender. It does cry out for nuts or raisins though.
