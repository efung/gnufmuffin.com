It's hot this week, so I was in the mood for more ice cream. Who am I kidding,
it doesn't need to be hot for me to be in the mood for frozen treats. Or any kind
of dessert, really. With peaches in season right now, I turned two pounds of
fruit into a fragrant, satisfying ice cream.

The [recipe](https://blessusolord.blogspot.ca/2011/07/peach-ice-cream.html) is by Emily
Luchetti, and can be found in her book, [A Passion for Ice Cream](/tag/a-passion-for-ice-cream/).
She suggests a pairing with oatmeal financiers, but since this ice cream is egg-less,
I didn't make them, as there weren't any leftover egg whites.

The fruit needs a bit of prep: peeling, pitting and chopping, then simmering it with sugar
to break the fruit down a bit, and eliminate some water. I saved washing an extra pot by microwaving
the dairy until it was hot, then combined it with the peaches. After an overnight chill,
I churned the thick mixture. The flavour was unmistakably peaches and cream, and not too sweet.
A great summer dessert.
