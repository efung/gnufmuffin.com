excerpt: "I made a half recipe of this using 70% bittersweet chocolate. Do pay close attention to the temperature of the custard, as it is crucial to achieving the proper texture. I like that you don\'t have to bake these in a water bath and they taste extremely smooth and silky. Portion size is key, as I filled"

Do pay close attention to the temperature of the custard, as it is crucial to achieving the proper texture. I like that you don't have to bake these in a water bath and they taste <span style="font-style:italic;">extremely</span> smooth and silky. Portion size is key, as I filled three 6 oz. cups with the half batch, and each one was too much for a single serving. Highly recommended for the chocolate lover.
