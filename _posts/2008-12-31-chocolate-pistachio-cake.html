excerpt: "This was to be a birthday cake but turned into a New Year\'s Eve dessert. This flourless cake uses ground pistachios in the batter as well as chopped nuts as a garnish.

This flourless cake uses ground pistachios in the batter as well as chopped nuts as a garnish. A food processor is used to make the cake, leaving the stand mixer free to whip the egg whites. Instead of a springform tin, I used a 9" cake pan with a false bottom, lined with a parchment circle. The cake puffed up in the oven, but sunk after cooling, so I flipped it upside down. One of the easiest and most delicious cakes to make, and a nice finish for our year-end celebration.<br /><br /><b>Note</b>: I have the UK edition of this book, but if you have the US one, please see the <a href="http://www.nigella.com/product/changes_domestic_goddess.aspx">errata list</a> from Nigella's website for a clarification to this recipe (and other corrections to this cookbook).
