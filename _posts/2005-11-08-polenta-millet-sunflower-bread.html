excerpt: "This is a pretty simple bread, containing lots of whole grains. She doesn\'t call for soaking the polenta and millet in the liquid, but I would do it for next time. I\'m not that fond of crunchy millet. Texture was a bit crumbly (longer kneading next time?) and there\'s an &ldquo;off&rdquo; aroma. However,"

She doesn't call for soaking the polenta and millet in the liquid, but I would do it for next time. I'm not that fond of crunchy millet. Texture was a bit crumbly (longer kneading next time?) and there's an &ldquo;off&rdquo; aroma. However, the browned sunflower seeds on top are delicious. I mixed and kneaded this bread with my new KitchenAid stand mixer. The <a href="http://www.kitchenaid.ca/english/product.php?id=4KP26M1X&context=features&colour=PM">mixer</a> got top marks in the Nov/Dec 2005 Cook's Illustrated which got me thinking. Through fortunate timing, I got a great deal on it from Linens 'n Things.
