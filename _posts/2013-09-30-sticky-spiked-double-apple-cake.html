excerpt: "We went apple picking a few weeks ago, and basically just picked Honeycrisp. Since these apples are twice the cost of other varieties, it seems a waste to bake with them, but they are apparently a good variety for pies, cakes, etc. So with a vegetable drawer full of Honeycrisps, plus a BBQ on our deck"

Since these apples are twice the cost of other varieties, it seems a waste to bake with them, but they are apparently a good variety for pies, cakes, etc. So with a vegetable drawer full of Honeycrisps, plus a BBQ on our deck holding another bag more, I decided to make an apple cake.<br /><br />As it was a cake for the office, and Dr. S wouldn't be eating it, I was able to incorporate brandy-soaked raisins. Without any actual dried apple rings, I substituted a packet of a dried apple snack that I must have bought at an Asian grocery: they're extremely crisp and oily, as if they were deep-fried. The soaking mixture had no effect on the water-repelling apple chips, so I had to break them up to encourage them to soften. Warm spices, toasted nuts, and apple chunks, both peeled and unpeeled, completed the batter.<br /><br />Even though I baked it in a slightly larger pan (13.5"&times;9.5"), the cake turned out fine. It was moist, flavourful and full of autumn flavour. <i>In the Sweet Kitchen</i> rarely disappoints!
