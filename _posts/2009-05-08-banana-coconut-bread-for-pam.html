excerpt: "After receiving 6 bunches of bananas from my cousin (courtesy of the Toronto film industry), we\'ve enjoyed eating them in banana bread and banana ricotta pancakes. But Dr. S didn\'t find the flavour of my favourite banana recipe intense enough, so I went searching for something that would use even more"

But Dr. S didn't find the flavour of my favourite banana recipe intense enough, so I went searching for something that would use even more bananas. This recipe uses 7 bananas (3 cups mashed) and included coconut for an interesting variation. It's also egg-free, in case you know anyone with an allergy. The texture was a bit crumbly and I think I would toast the coconut next time. But it did have a much stronger banana flavour, and I would make this again.<br /><br />Here is <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2007/02/i-really-really-shouldnt.html">Orangette's take</a>.
