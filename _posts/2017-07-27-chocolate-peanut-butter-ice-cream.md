When making dessert for other people, it's tough to convince them to try the 
experimental or exotic. Most eaters want the tried and true. So when I lugged 
my brand new ice cream maker to a cottage this week, and a copy of the 
[Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream Book](http://www.vanleeuwenicecream.com/the-cookbook/),
I wasn't surprised that my picks, like Sichuan peppercorn, or, roasted banana,
were rejected. Instead, we settled on the classic pairing of chocolate and peanut butter.

The cookbook I brought had a fancy variation, calling for a salted peanut
butter base, with chocolate dipped pretzels. But it didn't incorporate a significant
amount of PB nor chocolate in the ice cream. So instead, I turned to this 
[recipe](http://theculinarycouple.com/2011/07/21/chocolate-peanut-butter-ice-cream/)
I found online, from David Lebovitz' cookbook.

I made two batches: in the first, I used a freshly ground 100% nut PB (the kind without
sugar, salt or hydrogenated fat). It was disappointing, to say the least. Not only did
the texture suffer from teeny bits of unground peanuts, it lacked depth and was
quick to melt. The chocolate flavour was also quite muted.

The second batch, made using Kraft Extra Creamy Peanut Butter, and a heaping Â¼ cup of cocoa powder,
pushed the resulting ice cream beyond delicious, and into over-the-top territory. Not only
was it full of peanut and chocolate flavours, the sugar and salt levels also made it 
dangerously addictive. There was no mistaking the flavour of this ice cream, and
we consumed the entire quart in a short period of time.
