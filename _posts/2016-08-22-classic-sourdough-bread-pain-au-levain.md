A recent issue of Cook's Illustrated magazine promoted a no-knead sourdough
bread, and because I've got a nice, tangy _levain_ right now, I wanted
to try it. However, in the fine print, they noted that there's an even
better variation as an online extra. Their take on _pain au levain_ took a lot
more time, but boy, was it worth it.

This [recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9082-classic-sourdough-bread-pain-au-levain) 
differs from their published no-knead recipe by using a small portion of whole wheat
flour, as well as additional folds to further develop the dough. However, it takes much more
time as you can see from this schedule:

<pre>
- (20 min) Stir dough, rest.
- (30 min) Add salt, rest.
- (30 min) Fold dough, rest (1)
- (30 min) Fold dough, rest (2)
- (30 min) Fold dough, rest (3)
- (30 min) Fold dough, rest (4)
- (60 min) Shape, rest.
- (12-24 hr) Refrigerate.

- (2-3 hr) Proof
- (60 min) Bake
</pre>

I was able to fit this into my weekday schedule, by doing the first set of steps right after dinner,
then doing the final proof and bake on the following evening.

Ensure that you thoroughly flour your bowl or banneton, as this dough is quite wet, and it ferments in
the fridge for an extended period of time. On one occasion when I made this bread, I used a bleached,
all-purpose flour to dust the banneton, and my dough stuck quite stubbornly. I ended up pouring out the dough,
pulling and scraping it onto the parchment, ruining the appearance of the loaf (it turned out fine after baking).

The most impressive thing about this bread, for me, were the wonderfully large, irregular holes I was able to 
achieve. As with other breads I've made in a covered Dutch oven, the crust browned and blistered thoroughly,
and yielded a satisfying chew. I would prefer a less flat loaf, but that depends on the size of your proofing
container, and how wet and well-kneaded your dough is. 

A few other notes on the recipe: 

1. My banneton diameter was 8", which I thought might be too small for this quantity of dough, but it fit perfectly,
without any spillover. Using a too-large bowl runs the risk of the dough deflating when you invert it onto your
parchment.

1. The large quantity (226 g) of starter in the ingredients means this recipe cuts down on waste when you are
refreshing your starter (which I do weekly now).

1. Whether you sift your whole wheat flour to remove the bran didn't seem to matter to me. I've made it with and
without sifting, I liked the texture of both loaves.
