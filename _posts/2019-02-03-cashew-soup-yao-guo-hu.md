For a sweet finish to our Chinese New Year dinner, Dr. S suggested 
something that wasn't [red bean soup](/2018/03/red-bean-soup-hong-dou-zhou.html):
instead, a nut-based [tong sui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_sui). 

The type of Cantonese dessert soup made from a sweetened nut puree is
known as a 糊 (wu4) which refers to the paste-like consistency. You can 
find dessert shops in places like Hong Kong with huge vats
filled with _wu_ made from peanut, walnut, almond, black sesame,
or blends.

For this cashew based one, I followed this
[recipe](https://en.christinesrecipes.com/2015/01/chinese-almond-dessert.html?m=1),
omitting the egg white, and replacing almonds with cashews. I soaked
the nuts for a couple of hours instead of overnight, knowing that
cashews get completely smooth when pulverized in a high-speed
blender, without the need to sieve. This soup was immensely satisfying,
with a wonderful fragrance and nuttiness. Leftovers thickened
considerably, but just stir a tablespoon of water into your bowl
before microwaving it.
