Five separate components make up this this strawberry lemon layer
cake from Momofuku [Milk Bar](/tag/Milk%20Bar/).

The
[recipe](http://milkbarstore.com/main/press/recipes-and-how-tos/#strawberry)
is not in the Milk Bar cookbook, but appears on their website.
If you're in New York, you can pay $95 and meet Tosi and
assemble your own cake. Check out the [slide
show](http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2014/02/behind-the-scenes-in-momofuku-milk-bars-kitchen-strawberry-lemon-layer-cake.html)
from Serious Eats' visit to Milk Bar. But you can make it yourself, if
you have perseverance, the proper equipment, and access to baking specialty
ingredients. Which, I suppose, is a big if.

As I've done for previous Milk Bar layer cakes, I decided to double the
quantities and end up with two cakes. Here's the timeline.

# Sunday
I made the milk crumb, lemon curd, jam and vanilla cake. The first two
components are ones that I've made from the book before. As I've done in
the past, I cut back on both the sugar and butter in the curd. 

For the vanilla sheet cake, I baked the double batch in a half sheet pan,
with a full sheet pan below it to catch drips (it didn't overflow
though).

There were no local strawberries at the farmer's market this weekend, so
I used two packages from California. I had a box of
Certo low-sugar pectin that was half-open, so I used that in this
recipe, reducing the total sugar by about one-third. It set very softly,
to a sauce-like consistency. I also couldn't find sherry
vinegar, so I just used more white wine vinegar, replacing a bit of it
with crappy cooking sherry. I _did_
have citric acid (aka sour salt) though, to boost the jam's brightness
and to cut through its sweetness.

# Monday
For the double batch of liquid cheesecake, I baked it in an 8×8" brownie pan
lined with parchment. It took me 30 minutes at 300°F for it to be set
but still jiggly in the centre. 

# Tuesday, assembly

With all the components made and chilled, it was time to combine a few
of them together.

To make the lemon cheesecake, which requires a partial recipe of lemon
curd, I whisked together 325g liquid cheesecake and 345g of lemon curd.
It was surprisingly loose, but still spreadable.

This cake needs one batch of pickled strawberry jam, plus another ¼
batch for the frosting. Since I only made a double batch of pickled 
strawberry jam for two cakes, I just took the quarter batch out of
the amount used for spreading on the cake.

As I finished assembly at midnight on Wednesday, I didn't bring the cake
into work until Thursday, to give it a full 12 hours in the freezer.

The cake has lots of strong flavours and textures, and is another winner.
In the future, I would add some bits of fresh strawberry somewhere, just 
to give your mouth a break from all the richness. Do serve it quite cold
(about three hours in the fridge after coming out of the freezer) so
that it's easier to slice. 

Incidentally, I've been reading [Salt Sugar
Fat](http://www.michaelmossbooks.com/home#book) by Michael Moss. That's
a pretty good description of this cake (and everything else I've made
from the Milk Bar cookbook).
