A breakfast of lemon-ricotta pancakes left us with a surplus of the 
whey cheese. Ricotta is not a dairy product I usually have in the 
fridge, so this leftover ingredient allowed me to peruse pages of 
my cookbooks that are ordinarily unread. As luck would have it,
we stumbled on this personal-sized dessert that we enjoyed
over many nights.

The [recipe](https://www.tastecooking.com/recipes/baked-ricotta-hazelnut-cheesecakes/)
comes from the _Sweet_ book by Ottolenghi and Goh. This dessert
is a typical example of how I'm able to bake during the week, by
breaking the process down into multiple steps, done over several 
nights. 

On Monday evening, I roasted the unpeeled hazelnuts in a toaster
oven, then left them to cool. On Tuesday evening, I enlisted the
help of my daughter in rubbing the skins off the nuts, and in making
the cheesecakes. I chose to make the individual sized cheesecakes
in muffin tins, but I did not anticipate the surprisingly dull task
of measuring and cutting out little parchment circles for their
bases.

You need to employ the food processor (for grinding the chocolate
and hazelnuts) as well as a stand mixer (for creaming the butter
and sugar). Plus, you need to whip egg whites separately. So this
recipe is more involved than the average cheesecake, which can often
be done in one bowl. I admit that I made a few alterations,
due to lack of ingredients: I swapped in some walnuts for hazelnuts,
and Greek yogurt and cream for the ricotta,

On Wednesday evening, I tried to unmold the cheesecakes from
the tin. They stuck quite a bit on the edges, and needed a thin
knife to release; lining the bases with parchment is definitely 
mandatory. 

The final step in this recipe was to make the **water ganache**.
This was a completely wild process: making a dry caramel, then
pouring water over the hot sugar, letting it seize and then re-melt.
Finally, this amber liquid is poured over the chocolate, and a bit
of butter whisked in to emulsify.

Everyone _loved_ this dessert: served warm, the cake is especially
moist. It definitely resembles a nut cake, and not like a creamy
cheesecake at all. The ganache is more like a thick sauce and really
delivers a chocolate kick. We stored the leftover cakes in the
fridge, and microwaved one for about 10 seconds to rewarm. The metal
bowl of ganache was similarly easy to soften, directly over a low
flame for a minute or so. Highly recommended.
