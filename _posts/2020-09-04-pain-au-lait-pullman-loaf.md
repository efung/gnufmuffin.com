It's weird, but I feel just ever-so-slightly miffed whenever we
buy bread from the store. Sure, there are many great independent
bakeries in our city, and even the store-bought stuff can be decent.
But I know how to make the staff of life, and I like to provide for 
my family. So, when we couldn't find anything to make toast
with in our freezer, I made this plain white loaf.

The [recipe](http://www.recipehow.com/pain-au-lait-pullman-loaf-recipe/) 
comes from the _Bouchon Bakery_ cookbook. As with almost all of the loaves
in the book, the kneading time in the mixer is extended, 30 minutes in this
case. During shaping, I tucked the two long ends underneath the bread. This wasn't
called for in the book, and it turned out to be a mistake as it caused the baked
bread to have a little kink on each end.

I only applied the egg wash as I started to preheat the oven. This didn't seem 
to affect the end result. After about 2 hours, the bread had fully risen over
the edge of the Pullman pan. It touched the lid as I slid it on. During
baking, I actually heard one edge of the pan pop off! Next time, I'll keep
a closer eye on the rising, instead of just watching the clock. I think
the goal here is to have the dough spring in the oven to fill the pan 
exactly. For that to happen, it needs to bulk ferment until it almost reaches the 
edge of the pan.

The baked loaf is a beauty, nicely brown all over, with a nice, fine, even crumb.
It tastes a little richer than normal "Wonder" bread, and made great toast.
