When you buy the three-pound package of Philly cream cheese from
Costco, you'd better have some recipes in mind. And you'd better
have a lot of hungry mouths around too. These things were on my
mind this month, as I made **three** cheesecakes in the span of two
weeks. This one, though, was unlike any one I've ever made before
(and I've made [quite a few](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/tag/cheesecake/)).

The [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/07/epic-new-york-cheesecake-from-bravetart.html) 
is by Stella Parks, and comes from her first cookbook. There are so many interesting
ingredients and techniques: 

- The crust uses low proportion of butter to crumbs (and no sugar either), so the base doesn't get oily, or caramelized
- Goat cheese makes up 20% of the overall cheese ingredients, which provides a tangy, crumbly texture
- Orange flower water, lemon juice, and vanilla are all used to flavour the filling
- Eggs are beaten in all at once, streamlining the mixing process
- No water bath is needed
- The oven temperature starts out very high to provide lift, then the cake is finished at very low heat

Anyway, I could go on and on (and I did, to whoever would listen)
about how great this cheesecake is. It has a surprisingly light
texture, isn't too sweet, with a subtle flavouring, thanks to those
secret ingredients. Only one person noticed the goat cheese flavour,
and no one identified orange flower water.

Unfortunately, I only got one quick photo of the cake, as we were
so eager to slice into it at work. The only improvement, which was
just an omission I made in the interest of time, would be to make
a fresh fruit topping.
