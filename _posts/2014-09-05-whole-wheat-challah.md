For Shabbat dinners on Fridays, I often make the bread from scratch. On weeks where
we're too busy, I've discovered that the [Fresh &
Wild](http://www.freshandwild.ca/king-spadina/) near my office
stocks challahs from Harbord Bakery. But this past Friday, I wanted
to try making a whole wheat variation.

Peter Reinhart's *Whole Grain Breads* provided the
[recipe](http://honeyandspice.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/100-whole-wheat-challah/).
I made the soaker and biga on Thursday evening using [Red
Fife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fife_wheat) whole
wheat flour. The biga never turned into a tacky dough for me, and
instead resembled a stiff muffin batter.

Early on Friday morning, I completed the final dough. To keep the bread from
being too “healthy” tasty, I used white bread flour in the final dough
instead of whole wheat. I needed a **lot** of additional flour for the
dough to come together, maybe &frac34; to 1 cup more. By the time
I was done kneading, it was still a very tacky dough.

I rolled out six strands into long ropes, well longer than Reinhart's
recommendation of about 25 cm (10 in). In fact, they were so soft and
long, that I folded each one back on itself and re-rolled them. I left
the remaining proof, egg wash and baking with Flick.

The baked loaf was a bit of a letdown. As you can see from the first
photo (which shows less than half the loaf), the braid spread out sideways and
didn't rise much vertically. The texture of this challah was also
too crumbly. My best guess as to what heppened was that the coarsely
ground whole wheat flour altered the ability of this dough to absorb liquid, and I
didn't knead the additional white flour enough to develop its gluten.
Both of these combined to make a weak loaf that spread apart instead of
rising. I would try making this again with a finely milled whole wheat
flour.
