excerpt: "I needed to make a quick dessert for S\'s dinner party as she had suggested pie, but there wasn\'t enough time to make a crust (I know, what kind of a pastry chef am I if I don\'t have ready-to-use pie dough in my freezer?). This recipe popped up on Google so I gave it a shot. An interesting feature"

This recipe popped up on Google so I gave it a shot. An interesting feature is the use of both frozen and dried cranberries for texture and more flavour. I was a little short on the apples so tried to scale everything down, but I messed up on the butter. As a result (and also due to lack of refrigeration), the topping melted into a uniform crust. However, everyone really enjoyed this, especially with some vanilla bean ice cream. I found the tart-sweet combination delicious.
