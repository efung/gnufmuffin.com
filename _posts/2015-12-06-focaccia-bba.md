While it might not be a traditional [Hanukkah](/tag/hanukkah/) food
item, my wife came up with the excellent idea of serving focaccia
at our party. It's an airy, chewy flatbread, topped with herb oil.

To avoid craziness on Sunday, I started on this
[recipe](http://www.browneyedbaker.com/focaccia-bread-recipe/) much
earlier in the week. On Wednesday, I made the herb oil. Reinhart
suggests using a plain, light olive oil, rather than an expensive
extra-virgin one, since the delicate flavours would be lost amidst
the herbs. My combination included fresh parsley and basil;
dried oregano, thyme and rosemary; dried garlic and onion powders;
sweet paprika; coarse ground black pepper; and kosher salt.

After the dough was kneaded in the mixer, you need to fold and rest
it a few times. Then, you use fingertips to spread the dough to fill
a sheet pan, pouring the herb oil to fill the dimples. At this point,
I put the dough into the refrigerator, where it stayed until Sunday,
two and a half days later.

When I took the pan out of the fridge on Sunday morning, there were
a few large holes, which I flattened with my hands. They would otherwise
burn easily since the dough is so thin. Even more herb oil went on top,
while the dough completed its final rise.

Focaccia is thin so it doesn't take long to bake in a hot 450Â°F oven.
Mine was done around the expected time, about 20 minutes. Quite a bit of
oil was still left on the pan, though a lot of it did get absorbed.

I was pleased that the bread rose to a good height, and was quite
soft, featuring irregular holes throughout. A very successful
focaccia, with a recipe that has a flexible cold fermentation 
period, simplifying the process of getting fresh bread on the table.
