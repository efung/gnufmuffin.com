This _entremet_ of chocolate and hazelnut was impressive to behold, and,
with its contrasting layers of flavour and texture, equally delightful to
taste. There were a number of individual components to make and chill, but 
the end result was definitely worth it.

I didn't take a lot of photos to document this labour-intensive cake, because
the [recipe](http://www.roadtopastry.com/blog/recipes/cakes/recipe-chocolate-royal-cake-trianon) 
I followed already does a great job of that. Speaking of the recipe, it seems
that this cake goes by at least two names: "Royal" or "Trianon". French
Wikipedia has a [short article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_(p%C3%A2tisserie)) about it.

Anyway, I bought a bunch of things from [Vanilla Food Company](http://www.vanillafoodcompany.ca/) recently,
a Canadian online retailer of ingredients and equipment related to baking, cake decorating, chocolate, etc.
My order included a giant (2.5 kg) box of feuilletine, a package of [praline grains](http://www.vanillafoodcompany.ca/Hazelnuts-Praline-Grains-1-kg-2-2-lbs-Ca-p/cacbar-m-8j312-n-w77.htm), and milk chocolate callets.

Here are my notes about each component:

### Dacquoise
Depending on how well you whip the egg whites, the meringue layers may be very thin. You need to ensure that
they are nearly the full diameter of your cake ring. I needed a bit more than 20 minutes before the top felt 
dry and started to brown.

### Chocolate Praline
The ingredient list on the praline grains is crushed hazelnuts with caramel, at a ratio of 1:1. I thought this 
would be a shortcut to making my own praline paste. While it turned out fine, it lacked the intense aroma of
freshly roasted hazelnuts. This combination of hazelnut, chocolate and crispy wafers is super-addictive. I
could eat handfuls of this all day long.

### Chocolate Mousse
Since I only had one stand mixer bowl, I whipped the cream first and set it aside in the fridge, while I
made the pate a bombe.

### Chocolate Mirror Glaze
Interestingly, you need to make this ahead of time and refrigerate it. I found it too sweet, and would reduce
the amount of sugar next time.

Assembling the cake was pretty straightforward. One thing I neglected
to do was to run a knife around the outside of the cake ring, to
get rid of air pockets. I found that the dacquoise layer on the
bottom stayed crisp and chewy, since the praline acted as a barrier
to the mousse. Maybe it's personal preference, but I prefer a softer
base to a mousse cake.

All in all, this combination of hazelnut and chocolate is a real winner,
especially with its alternating soft and crunchy layers.
