The recent [breakfast compilation](https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-breakfast-recipes.html) 
from NYT Cooking had lots of exciting ideas for my favourite meal of
the day. Unfortunately, this baked oatmeal was a dud.

I had high hopes for this [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018672-baked-oatmeal-with-berries-and-almonds) 
as I like oatmeal, I like almonds, and I like berries. But 
this whole grain custard was a little strange and unfamiliar.

While spoonfuls of this warm breakfast were good at first, I couldn't
get over the semi-soft texture of the almonds, or the odd combination
of oats, egg, and berries. Would not make again.
