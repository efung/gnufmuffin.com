[Recipe](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/12166/sevengrain-honey-bread) from _Baking Bread: Old and New Traditions_ by Beth Hensperger. _Notes_: The honey makes the dough very tacky, even though there is quite a bit of butter and oil in it. During shaping, I tucked the ends under so it has a nice shape. Good oven spring. Loaf is tender and sweet.
