A tablespoon of <a href="http://www.zeronfinefoods.com/">Zeron's</a> dried lavender infused the cream with an herbal-floral taste. To make the shells, I added a few drops of red and blue food colouring to a small quantity of tempered white chocolate, then used a chopstick to paint the insides. When it was almost set, I poured more white chocolate into the cavities to create the outside as usual. White chocolate is difficult to work with, and I made the shells twice as the first attempt resulted in a lot of air pockets.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2147587496/" title="Lemongrass Coconut Chocolates by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2261/2147587496_ff46d89f04_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Lemongrass Coconut Chocolates" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Lemongrass Coconut</span>: I followed this recipe as written, with the exception of molding the truffles in milk chocolate instead of white. The centres have a nice, strong lemongrass taste, and not so much coconut; the mixture was very runny immediately after making it, so some refrigerator time was necessary to make it firm enough to scoop.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2147587788/" title="Peanut Butter Sizzle Chocolates by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2109/2147587788_92eddaa37f_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" class="inlineleft" alt="Peanut Butter Sizzle Chocolates" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Peanut Butter Sizzle</span>: The sizzle refers to the addition of cayenne pepper but a mere pinch was not enough for me to register any heat, so I added several. Natural peanut butter worked fine in this recipe. For coating, I used Ontario-grown Valencia peanuts purchased from Picard's Peanuts in Waterdown.<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2157583381/" title="Banana Chocolates by gnuf, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2380/2157583381_2047027120_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Banana Chocolates" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Banana</span>: The only disappointment in this batch of chocolates. I thought crushed banana chips might be a good substitute for the ground caramel called for in the Banana Caramel recipe, but they ended up softening and becoming chewy. There is a strong banana flavour in the milk and white chocolate ganache, but I realize I don't like banana and chocolate together (that's not quite true: I've made <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/105621">this easy dessert</a> many times).<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
