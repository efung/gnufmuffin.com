excerpt: "These buns were based on the White Bread recipe, Variation 2 (the one with buttermilk). I used yogurt, thinned with milk instead. Due to carelessness, I misread the instructions and sprinkled flour on top of the risen buns, before spritzing with water so that the seeds would adhere. You would think that"

I used yogurt, thinned with milk instead. Due to carelessness, I misread the instructions and sprinkled flour on top of the risen buns, before spritzing with water so that the seeds would adhere. You would think that after all these years of making bread, I wouldn't need to follow the steps so religiously and would just know how to top the buns. Anyway, these are far tastier buns than the standard supermarket ones and are worth the effort. We just froze the extras for a future barbeque.
