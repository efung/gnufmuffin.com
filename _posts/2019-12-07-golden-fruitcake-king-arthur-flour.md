With a family dinner approaching, I left my annual fruitcake baking to the
last minute. Without a lot of time to buy ingredients, macerate fruit,
and bake the loaves, I ended up making a basic light version. Along the way, 
I learned about the importance of aging.

The [recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/golden-fruitcake-recipe) I
used is from King Arthur Flour. At first, I thought it would be "interesting" to use
those bright red candied cherries as called for, but I talked some sense into
myself, and soaked dried Bing cherries in Amaretto instead.

The fruitcake is a pretty standard one, with a mix of raisins, other dried
tart and sweet fruits, some candied citrus peel, and a generous quantity of nuts.
I made it in two 8.5 x 4.5" loaf pans. After baking, I forgot to do the alcohol bath,
and ended up serving it less than 24 hours later.

The slices were crumbly and dry, and not all that tasty. I gave most of it to
my parents, with instructions to brush with alcohol weekly. I did save a few 
slices for myself, stored in a tightly sealed container. The extra week of
sitting around helped the cake's moisture redistribute, and the texture and
flavour improved considerably. [This article](https://www.thespruceeats.com/fruitcake-storage-1807766) 
recommends aging fruitcake for at least a month. This is a step
I won't skip in the future, but I'll have to get motivated to start the process in November.
