While vacationing at a cottage this past week, I had time to do some
baking in the well-stocked (both in pantry supplies and equipment)
kitchen. For a snack/dessert, I decided to make us a zucchini bread 
with squash bought at the [Haliburton Farmer's
Market](https://haliburtoncountyfarmersmarket.wordpress.com).

The
[recipe](http://recipetools.gotdns.com/johnsmags/mags/CI/129/CI-129.html#Zucchini_Bread_with_Pistachios_and_Orange)
is from Cook's Illustrated's August 2014 issue. Their key piece of
advice is to squeeze out all the moisture from the grated zucchini to
ensure the loaf isn't wet and gummy. I didn't have a scale, so a
conversion I found on the Internet suggested that 3 cups packed was
equivalent to 1&frac12; pounds of grated zucchini. Without a cheesecloth
or clean dish towels, I just grabbed handfuls and squeezed the liquid
out manually. In a nod to health, I used less brown sugar than
called for, by loosely filling my measuring cup, instead of packing it.

This loaf turned out reasonably moist, but its flavour was a bit off.
I'm not sure if some of the ingredients were stale, or that I had to
omit the orange peel due to lack of a zester, or that I only used
nutmeg as we didn't have cardamom. But it's definitely something
I'd try to make again, especially later in the season when zucchini
are plentiful in the markets.
