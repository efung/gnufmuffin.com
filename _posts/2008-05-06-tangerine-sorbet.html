excerpt: "I used an entire 3 lb bag of organic tangerines for this recipe. The recipe contains only sugar, water, tangerine and lemon juices, so it's not difficult.

The recipe contains only sugar, water, tangerine and lemon juices, so it's not difficult. It freezes quite firm and has a strong orange popsicle flavour. Perhaps I used too much zest, or the Microplane releases too much of the volatile oils, but the tangerine aroma is pronounced. Not bad, just a little too intense.
