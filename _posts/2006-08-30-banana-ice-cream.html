The schmutz was slightly overcooked as the brown sugar made it hard to tell when to take the pan off heat. I omitted the vanilla seeds from the custard base (and used a bit of extract), as I didn't want anything to distract from the banana flavour. And what flavour! Real, ripe bananas that have been caramelized give this ice cream an intensity I've never experienced before. It came out quite soft though, like frozen pudding, even after packing overnight. Even if I had a larger canister, I don't think I would make the recipe as directed (using a full recipe of vanilla custard) as it would dilute the banana flavour. This one is a keeper.
