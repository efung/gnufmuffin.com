Having made <a href="/2009/05/hamburger-buns.html">Variation 3</a> of this White Bread previously, I wanted to try a different one. The first variation uses powdered milk solids (a.k.a skim milk powder). It made a beautiful soft dough, very easy to work with. I didn't weigh each dough ball out, but just eyeballed it. Spritzing the tops with water would make the seeds adhere better, or, as the recipe suggests, glazing the tops with an egg wash. Homemade hamburger buns really do taste better!
