I food-processed the ripe figs, yielding about 2 cups, combined it with 2&frac12; cups of food-processed blue plums, then added a cup of <a href="http://www.torontolife.com/guide/wine/fortified-and-fruit-wines/taylor-fladgate-2001-late-bottled-vintage-port/">port</a> and a box of no-sugar pectin. The mixture was quite thick and sputtered furiously, so I needed to stir it constantly to avoid splatters. An extra half cup of water thinned it out a little bit. After tasting the mix, I ended up adding two cups of sugar. The jam set into a spreadable consistency, and the flavours blended well together, but the cooked taste isn't all that appealing.
