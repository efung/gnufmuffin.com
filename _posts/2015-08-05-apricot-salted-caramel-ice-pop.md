This past weekend's market trip netted us 7L each of apricots and
peaches. [Bizjak Farms](http://bizjakfarms.com/) delivered again, with
fragrant, ripe and juicy apricots. As well as eating them fresh out of
hand, we turned them into a few apricot desserts this week.

First, we tried them in an ice pop, married with salted caramel. The
recipe says not to bother, but I blanched the apricots in boiling water
and slipped their skins off. Making the caramel was awkward, as I had
forgotten how to do a dry caramel, and ended up with the sugar at the
edges of the pan caramelizing before the rest had melted. With a bit of
diligent scraping, I ended up with a homogeneous, amber-coloured liquid.

Because the single batch of caramel yields just over half a cup, adding
the small amounts of cream and butter did not cause the molten sugar to
bubble and boil over. I left the finished salted caramel cool to almost
room temperature before pureeing it with the apricots. As for the simple
syrup, I debated whether adding _more_ sugar was necessary, but my wife
did point out that liquid contributed to the texture. I compromised by
using less sugar, but sticking with the specified volume of water.

These ice pops were extremely good: creamy texture, bright tang from the
stone fruit, and a subtle sweet-salty finish from the caramel. It
was too subtle for me, but I suppose any stronger and it would have
overwhelmed the apricot. Highly recommended.
