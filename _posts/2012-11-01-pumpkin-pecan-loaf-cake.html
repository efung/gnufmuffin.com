excerpt: "We\'re finally working our way through the last bit of pumpkin and kabocha purees. This recipe makes two loaves: I made one with pecan and raisins, and another with cranberry and pumpkin seeds. Instead of canned puree, I used my homemade, roasted squash. It\'s nothing special: not hard to make, not bad"
