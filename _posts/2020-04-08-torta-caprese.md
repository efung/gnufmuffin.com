For the recent Passover holiday, I came up with a few new ideas,
like pavlova (giant baked meringue, with fresh fruit and cream),
or thumbprint nut cookies for my family. But, predictably, they requested a
flourless chocolate cake. Sigh, chocolate always wins.

Looking through my past [Passover](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/tag/passover/)
experiments, I can see many variations of chocolate nut cakes.
But this time around, I used a [recipe](https://gourmetliving.org/italian-chocolate-almond-cake/)
from Cook's Illustrated (Nov 2018) for something called _torta caprese_. 
It's an Italian chocolate cake made with ground almonds.

I took out the bag of ground almonds from the freezer, to take the chill 
off of them. My son helped me scale and melt the butter and chocolate, 
as well as whip the egg whites and yolks. The batter was quite thick,
thicker than I would have expected for something lightened with
stiffly beaten whites. 

The baked cake turned out quite nicely, but didn't look as high 
as the one in the magazine. Maybe I deflated the mixture too much.
But in the mouth, it wasn't dense at all. It was hard to describe:
it yielded easily, but wasn't fluffy. We didn't make any additional
desserts for the week, so this was a wonderful treat for a few
nights in a row.
