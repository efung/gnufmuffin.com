excerpt: " The summer mango season is always a time when we try to purchase a case or two of mangos. We eat them fresh for a snack, chopped into a fruit salad or salsa, or blended into a lassi or smoothie. One of our favourites is the Ataulfo variety, which has a small pit, and very smooth, non-fibrous texture."

time when we try to purchase a case or two of mangos. We eat them
fresh for a snack, chopped into a fruit salad or salsa, or blended

For a different treat this week, I tried making this classic Thai
dessert for the first time.</p><a name='more'></a><p>The 
<a href="http://indirectheat.blogspot.ca/2011/03/mango-sticky-rice.html">recipe</a> 
is from <i>The Sweet Spot</i> by Pichet Ong. I happened to
have a bag of glutinous rice already, so the only special ingredient
we needed was palm sugar; my wife found it at an Asian grocer. In
the morning before work, I soaked the raw grains in water. When I
came home, I rinsed and drained the rice, then put it directly in
the steamer insert of a pot, as I didn't have any cheesecloth. While
the rice was cooking, I took the palm sugar, and broke down the
discs into small chunks using a sharp knife. The rest of the coconut
milk mixture was easy to put together, and the rich, fragrant mixture
was soaked up by the warm, cooked rice. One thing to note is that
the rice dries out very quickly, so make sure to keep any leftover
portions covered tightly.</p><p>It's hard to describe how coconut,
palm sugar and vanilla smell and taste together, but it's an
absolutely divine combination with sticky rice and mango. There's
lots of contrasts in this dessert too: warm and cool, chewy and
smooth, and sweet and tart. The leftovers even made an appearance
at my breakfast table the next day.</p> </div> {% endraw %}
