With the last of the big basket of blueberries, we turned them into these
beautifully marbled ice pops. The swirl of purple and white entices you, 
but the flavour of these ice pops was underwhelming.

Following the basic formula set out in the book, the [recipe](http://www.nola.com/food/index.ssf/2012/05/blueberry_buttermilk_ice_pops_1.html) mixes simple syrup with pureed fruit. In this case,
the authors recommend straining out the skins, which I did. They also
mention a weird thing that happens, which I also observed: the raw puree
tends to congeal in clumps. Instead of stirring in the buttermilk, I
poured a few teaspoons at a time into each mold, alternating with
the blueberry.

While these were nice to look at, I didn't think these ice pops were
very good. There wasn't a good contrast between the dairy and fruit
flavours, nor did the raw, cultivated blueberries stand out.
