excerpt: "We bought a lot of pears and peaches on our trip to the Jordan/Vineland area recently. One of Dr. S\' friends raved about a book about canning small quantities so we checked it out at Indigo and bought it on the spot. A lot of the recipes do indeed make small batches, like 2 cups or so. We tried this"

One of Dr. S' friends raved about a book about canning small quantities so we checked it out at Indigo and bought it on the spot. A lot of the recipes do indeed make small batches, like 2 cups or so. We tried this recipe to use up our peaches and pears. I thought that the recipe would produce a pretty firm jam as it called for no liquid but the regular amount of powdered pectin to go with 4 cups of fruit. Even though I increased the fruit by a cup, it still set very firmly. Five cups of sugar seemed insane, so we reduced it to three, but it was still too sweet. I only buy the no-sugar pectin now, so we can completely control the sweetness of jams we make. Flavour-wise, the lime was very subtle, even though I doubled the quantity of zest, but the fresh peaches really come through. We'll enjoy this later on in the winter, stirred into plain yogurt, spread on toast or on top of waffles.
