excerpt: "Muffins really are just small, unfrosted cakes, so why not a carrot cake muffin? This recipe comes from the Recipes for Health column of the NYT, explaining the use of whole-grain flour and reduced sugar and fat. I didn\'t have whole-wheat pastry flour, so I used a mix of regular whole-wheat and cake"

This recipe comes from the Recipes for Health column of the NYT, explaining the use of whole-grain flour and reduced sugar and fat. I didn't have whole-wheat pastry flour, so I used a mix of regular whole-wheat and cake flour. I also didn't have buttermilk and used plain milk, and chose pecans over raisins. Lastly, my carrots were from a bag containing various colours, from yellow to orange to purple.<br /><br />These muffins were pretty good: they tasted like carrot cake with its spices and moistness. Mine turned out a bit dense, but had I used buttermilk, its acidity combined with baking soda might have resulted in a lighter muffin.
