With some leftover mascarpone in hand, I decided to combine two of the variations in Sherry Yard's basic ice cream recipe. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/2690786705/" title="Pistachio Mascarpone Ice Cream"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3038/2690786705_f08356a44b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pistachio Mascarpone Ice Cream"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The recipe is from [The Secrets of Baking](/tag/the-secrets-of-baking/). There's nothing too special about this, and I actually don't enjoy the fine, grainy texture that the cream cheese adds. It's also not tangy enough to balance the sweetness.
