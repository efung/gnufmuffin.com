excerpt: "Edamame were filling Dr. S\' freezer so I took two frozen containers home and looked for recipes to use them and found this involved dessert. As the beans were already cooked, I just microwaved them per the directions, shelled them, and also slipped off the thin skins. The ice cream base uses dry milk"

As the beans were already cooked, I just microwaved them per the directions, shelled them, and also slipped off the thin skins. The ice cream base uses dry milk powder whose unique taste stood out. Pureeing the mixture in a food processor didn't yield a very smooth result; it's got bits of bean in it. In terms of colour, it's a very pale and pleasing green, but the taste is unremarkable. Making the grapefruit marmalade was easy, as was the pastry. The latter needs a little bit of kneading to bring the dough together but it rolls out easily and cleanly. The grapefruit slices never got completely dry on the outside but maybe the point is not to have them soggy. I placed the segments on a piece of parchment on top of a rack to ensure both sides got airflow. This combination is pretty interesting, what with the little touches like sesame and celery leaves (!). My favourite would be the marmalade with its hint of star anise.
