excerpt: "I first heard about Fany Gerson from this video about Dough, her donut shop in Brooklyn. When her first cookbook about Mexican sweets came out, I flipped through it at Indigo and, while it was full of her meticulous research and beautifully designed, there wasn\'t anything in it that really spoke to"

When her first cookbook about Mexican sweets came out, I flipped through it at Indigo and, while it was full of her meticulous research and beautifully designed, there wasn't anything in it that really spoke to me. I know very little of Mexican treats and hadn't been looking for a book like hers.<br /><br />But her latest book, about frozen treats, sounds awesome. I came across the linked <i>paleta</i> recipe recently, along with others like <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/08/white-sangria-paletas-popsicles-frozen-fruit-dessert-recipe.html">white sangria</a> and <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/pineapple-chile-paletas-popsicles-recipe.html">pineapple chile</a>. Our friends picked up an inexpensive set of molds from Kitchen Stuff Plus and we were all set. Pureeing an avocado, lime juice, and simple syrup took no time at all, so this popsicle recipe can be made by anybody.<br /><br />What a delicious treat these were. Creamy (but dairy-free), luscious and sweet. Thumbs up!
