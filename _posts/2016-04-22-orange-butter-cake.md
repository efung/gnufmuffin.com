I've made at least four other flourless, orange cakes for [Passover](/tag/passover/)
but I'm always on the lookout for new ones. As published, this cake isn't
KLP (_kosher l'pesach_), but with a few adjustments, and a trial run,
we made two cakes very successfully for this year's festival dinners.

The [recipe](http://thecookiescoop.blogspot.com/2010/08/orange-butter-cake.html) comes
from Sherry Yard's [Dessert by the Yard](/tag/desserts-by-the-yard/). Butter is in 
quotation marks because she claims it has a buttery taste, but I call shenanigans.

To start, you need to boil two oranges: this softens the fruit (peel,
pith and flesh) and takes away a bit of the bitterness. Next, the grated
ginger, a full two tablespoons, is food-processed into a bit of sugar,
then the boiled oranges are incorporated and ground into a fine paste. All
of the structure and lift for the cake is provided by the eggs, which
need whipping for an extended period (12 minutes) and become very, very
pale and increase in volume substantially. For the dry ingredients,
I used a toaster oven to lightly brown store-bought ground almonds.
Everything is combined carefully in several additions, then the whole
thing is baked in a springform.

Depending on your level of observance or tradition, you may omit the
baking powder, and/or substitute matzo cake meal for the cake flour
(or omit it completely). I tried it last week _with_ baking powder,
but _without_ cake flour, and it turned out fine. For the two
nights of Passover, I made it _without_ baking powder, but _with_
matzo meal, and they also turned out fine.

The cake has a wonderful orange and ginger flavour, and is drier on the
perimeter than the centre, which is wetter and more moist. All three
cakes that I made sunk in the middle during baking, so that's to be
expected. If I were to make it again, I'd try this recipe in a tube
pan. Do let the cake cool completely before trying to unmold it, or it
will fall apart. We served this with lemon curd, but it's delicious on
its own.
