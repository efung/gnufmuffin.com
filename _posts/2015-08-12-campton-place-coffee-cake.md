At the [Withrow Park Farmers' Market](http://withrowmarket.com/) this
week, there was a table piled with cookbooks for sale. I was able to
pick up Sherry Yard's second book, 
[Desserts by the Yard](/tag/desserts-by-the-yard/). Within in its pages,
I found a coffee cake with a filling containing peaches.

The
[recipe](http://leitesculinaria.com/427/recipes-campton-place-coffee-cake.html)
for the cake is pretty standard: creaming butter, sugar and eggs,
then mixing in the flour and sour cream in several additions. The
filling has both cinnamon and cocoa, which is a nice combination I
hadn't seen before, but is obvious in retrospect. I omitted the sliced
almonds to keep it nut-free, but did use lots of fresh, diced peaches.

To prepare the Bundt pan, I used plain PAM spray, followed by a dusting
of AP flour. Layering the batter and filling requires a bit of
patience. The cake batter is thick and is difficult to spread evenly,
especially over the powdery filling. You want to cover each layer
completely, so that slices of the cake will end up being uniform.

The cake released cleanly from the pan without any trouble. The next
day, at work, I dusted the top with icing sugar just before serving. 
The peach chunks really make this coffee cake a step above the everyday. 
I'd make this again.
