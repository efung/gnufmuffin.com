It isn't quite peach season here in southern Ontario, but a recent New York Times
recipe had me buying some fruit from south of the border just to make it. This 
unique poundcake incorporates peach into the batter in two ways, and even uses
it in the icing.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021204-peach-poundcake) is
by cookbook author [Jerrelle Guy](https://www.instagram.com/chocolateforbasil/?hl=en) from
her book, [_Black Girl Baking_](https://www.chocolateforbasil.com/black-girl-baking). 
It's much less fussy than pound cake methods that involve creaming the butter and
sugar, as you can just melt the butter here, and stir all the ingredients together.

However, you do need to bust out a food processor. This is to blitz some of the peaches (skin
and all) to make 1 cup puree to stir into the batter. Speaking of fruit, it's hard to know what 
a "medium" sized peach is, so definitely weigh them. I ended up using four smaller peaches. Also, the remaining
puree is used to make the icing, but the recipe gives no quantity. So if you have too much,
you'll end up adding more icing sugar to thicken it. Instead, what I should have done, is to slowly
add my puree to a fixed quantity of sugar, stopping when the right consistency was reached.
One final tip: defer Step 1 (dice up one of the peaches), so that the exposed surfaces don't
brown, and cut them on top of a paper towel to absorb any excess liquid.

It was really hard to let this cake cool before eating it. We dug in while it was still barely
warm, and it was **heavenly**. Such a tender, moist crumb, with a distinct peach aroma. We all
wanted more fruit chunks, but I didn't have any more to garnish the cake! This pound cake held 
pretty well too, remaining moist two days later at room temperature. It's been a while
since I've come across a recipe that wows me like this, but I'm excited to add it to my
repertoire.
