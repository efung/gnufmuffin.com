Just can't get enoughâ€¦ peaches, that is. This week, we probably purchased our 
fifth 3L basket of the season. Besides eating them out of hand,
we've made pie, [BBQ sauce](https://twitter.com/gnufmuffin/status/764913716940902401),
salsas, smoothies, ice pops, added them to tomato soup, and now this week, shortcakes.

Cook's Illustrated designed the
[recipe](http://passthesushi.com/peach-shortcakes/) to work with
peaches available year-round. But in the height of summer, there's
no need to macerate the peaches for too long, nor make the mash or
spike the fruit with liqueur. We just tossed the sliced peaches
with a tiny bit of sugar. As for the shortcakes, we swapped buttermilk
with the suggested yogurt/milk combination, and I replaced half the 
AP flour with sifted cake flour, to ensure tenderness.

A fresh, split biscuit, covered in juicy peaches and whipped cream: that 
says summer. Everyone loved this dessert, especially with extra helpings
of fruit. A day later, however, and the shortcakes were significantly
inferior: they became drier and denser.
