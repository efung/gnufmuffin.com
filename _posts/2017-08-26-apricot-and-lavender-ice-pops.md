Rounding out this whirlwind month of baking and dessert, I combined
a basket of small, ripe stonefruit with a fragrant herb growing
in my backyard. The result was a subtly scented apricot and
lavender frozen treat that captured the essence of late summer.

After gently simmering the apricots in water, I pur√©ed the fruit
in a blender, then combined it with a simple syrup infused with
six sprigs of fresh lavender. It's hard to know how much to use,
but this amount was just right for me. You might want to adjust
the flavour with a bit of lemon juice, depending on your fruit.

These ice pops turned out really nicely, save for one thing:
one of the apricots must have been very fibrous, as every popsicle
has some woody, stringy bits embedded in it. It made for a
very distracting and unpleasant eating/licking experience.
