People like to name things after other things that have the same shape, e.g.
U-turn, grape tomato, dogleg golf hole. I've never seen the appeal of
a doughnut or [Saturn peach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Peach), 
a flat, round variety that has less flesh and juice than regular yellow
or white peaches. Still, I decided to give them a shot this weekend, 
recalling a picture in one of my cookbooks.

The [recipe](http://www.bakingobsession.com/2008/08/07/ring-of-saturn-peach-doughnuts-with-vanilla-ice-cream/)
I was thinking of comes from Sherry Yard's, [Desserts by the Yard](/tag/desserts-by-the-yard/).
It highlights the shape of the flat stone fruit by turning it 
into something resembling a real doughnut. Before macerating the peaches 
in a lemon-scented syrup, I tried to peel 
them by blanching in boiling water. However, the thick skins stubbornly 
stayed on, so I pulled them off as best as I could. Here's the flat 
fruit after sitting in the syrup all day:

Instead of making a batch of anise biscotti, I took some leftover
pistachio biscotti I had in the freezer, toasted it to dry it out,
then blitzed it with more pistachios and a good pinch of aniseed.
Making the coating for these peaches is just like making
battered fish: dip the pieces in flour, then egg, then the crumbs.

Don't they look like real doughnuts?! I baked them in a moderate oven
for the full baking time (15 + 10 minutes) as the peaches still 
felt firm and I wanted the nuts and crumbs to get really brown.

The outer crust doesn't get very crispy, nor did the peaches get meltingly
tender, but there's a definite contrast between the nutty crumbs and
the cooked fruit.

I enjoyed this whimsical dessert, how it emphasizes the fruit, so you don't
feel bad for eating more than one at a time. Obviously, if you don't like 
anise, you could swap in a different spice. And you could easily adapt
the recipe to regular peaches cut in thick slices, or with other dry, cookie
crumbs also.
