On New Year's Eve, I still hadn't decided on a dessert to cap our eat-in, takeout
dinner from local restaurants [Favorites Thai](https://www.myfavethai.com/) and [Alma](http://www.almatoronto.com/).
Finally, I thought that a batch of Ã©clairs wouldn't be too much trouble,
and provide an opportunity for little hands to help. I used a recipe from
the [Duchess Bake Shop](https://duchessbakeshop.com/collections/cookbooks/products/new-duchess-bake-shop-cookbook) cookbook. Here's how it went down:

# PÃ¢te Ã  Choux
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/50788622316/in/dateposted/" title="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50788622316_b34d060652_c.jpg" width="542" height="800" alt="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Choux pastry is something I've made many times, but my results are always inconsistent.
This time, I had my mise en place all ready: eggs cracked, in a glass cup with a spout; 
flour measured in a bowl; pencil lines drawn on the parchment.

This recipe has some helpful tips: one is to ensure you stir the batter in the pot
for a full 5 minutes. I made sure to do that, switching arms halfway!

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/50788729607/in/photostream/" title="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50788729607_e7413018f6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Once the batter was "cooked", I dumped it into the mixer, and added the eggs one at a time.
It seemed very soft and squishy. Sure enough, when I piped the straight lines out, the dough
spread out on the pan.

After baking, they looked pretty good. I recalled other recipes telling you to poke holes to vent
any trapped steam, so I did that. Still, my baked Ã©clairs deflated quite a bit into flattened canoes.
I let them sit a room temperature, uncovered, for a few hours.

# Raspberry Curd
The cookbook's note on fruit purÃ©es is not helpful: at their bakery, they use
commercial fruit products that have consistent levels of sugar and acid. I wasn't about
to buy [Boiron](https://www.my-vb.com/us) products just for this, so I thawed some
frozen raspberries, crushed them by hand, then pushed them through a sieve.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/50788626641/in/photostream/" title="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50788626641_055a7d97a2_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I cooked the curd in a metal bowl over a small pot of simmering water. When it reached
about 180â„‰, I poured the mixture into a sieve over the bowl with the cold butter. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/50787868728/in/photostream/" title="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50787868728_6eea21b2f9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After stirring to melt most of the butter chunks, there were still a few small pieces left. 
There wasn't enough heat to melt all of it, so I used an immersion blender to break up
the last few bits. Finally, I chilled the mixture in the refrigerator for a few hours.

# Dark Chocolate Ganache
Not much to talk about here. I took some 72% chocolate callets, broke them up by hand, then melted
them in the microwave. I also nuked a measuring glass with cream and glucose, then poured
it over the melted chocolate. This mixture also needed to be chilld in the fridge.

# Assembly
After we came back from our walk, about 10 minutes before midnight, we were ready to assemble.
First, I cut out an oval window in the top of each baked Ã©clair. The consistency of 
the raspberry curd was quite spreadable, and it was easy to pipe into the cavities.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/50787868603/in/photostream/" title="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50787868603_11e38f1316_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Raspberry Dark Chocolate Ã‰clairs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then, we placed raspberries on top, then piped chocolate rosettes between the fruit. Unfortunately,
the ganache was still a bit soft, so the piped shapes didn't hold, and melted into jiggly puddles.

Overall, we were really pleased with this decadent dessert. Every bite had a mixture of 
crisp shell, buttery curd, intense chocolate, and berry. A nice snack with a glass of 
champagne ðŸ˜‰!

Some things to improve for next time: getting the baked Ã©clairs to hold their shape after
cooling, and ensuring the ganache is at the right temperature for piping.
