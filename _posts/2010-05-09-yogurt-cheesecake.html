excerpt: "As part of a Mother's Day BBQ we hosted, I wanted to make a dessert that I knew would be familiar to my Mom and that we all enjoyed. This yogurt cheesecake has been in our family since I was a kid, back when we used to make homemade yogurt. That machine is now long gone, but we still make this cheesecake"

This yogurt cheesecake has been in our family since I was a kid, back when we used to make homemade yogurt. That machine is now long gone, but we still make this cheesecake from time to time. What makes it stand out for me is that the yogurt provides additional tanginess, while also making the texture lighter. Because I baked it in an 8" springform rather than a 10" one, I needed additional baking time to set the centre, but that meant the top got quite browned. Some people prefer a nice pale top that's smooth, but you need a water bath to get that.
