excerpt: "I based these chocolates on the Grand Marnier recipe from this book. My coworker gave me a generous amount of frozen yuzu peel from Japan. I took a heaping tablespoon, minced it and used it to infuse the cream. For added citrus flavour, I put a few drops of natural orange oil in the ganache as well."

My coworker gave me a generous amount of frozen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzu">yuzu</a> peel from Japan. I took a heaping tablespoon, minced it and used it to infuse the cream. For added citrus flavour, I put a few drops of natural orange oil in the ganache as well. The filling tended to break as I cut it, but letting it warm for about 20 minutes made it bit easier. I'm still having trouble with the dipping. The trick must be getting the chocolate warm enough so that it is more viscous so the pieces slide off the fork. Also, not tapping the dipped piece because it causes the tines to dig into the foot or the filling. The citrus flavour is very, very subtle. <a href="http://www.somachocolate.com/">Soma Chocolatier</a> makes a chocolate bar with green tangerine oil that is amazing, the standard I'm trying to meet.
