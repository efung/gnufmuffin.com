Our recent grocery haul included two litres of buttermilk. Besides being a
key component of pancakes, I often use it for muffins, buns, and other
baked goods. A photo in a recent magazine article about _panna cotta_ 
sounded so good and simple, that I immediately added gelatin to my next 
shopping trip, just to make this dessert.

The
[recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/12596-buttermilk-grapefruit-panna-cotta-with-caramel-coated-almonds)
comes from the current May 2020 issue of Cook's Illustrated. This is
probably one of the easiest desserts to make, but the authors still
found a few tricks to improve it. By mixing the powdered gelatin into
the sugar, you can skip the step of blooming the gelatin, since
each granule is dispersed and can readily absorb the water from
the cream. Heating the grapefruit zest in the dairy mixture ensures
that all the flavourful oils are extracted.

I knew the garnish wasn't optional: I absolutely love caramelized
nuts. But the technique used in this recipe was new to me. You
dump water, sugar, sliced almonds and **oil** into a saucepan,
and bring everything to a vigorous simmer. It took a lot longer
than 10 minutes for my almonds to start to get a caramel coating,
maybe twice as long, as I was timid with the heat.
What's weird, is that at the end, you end up with greasy, but
well-caramelized almonds submerged in oil. After straining the nuts 
out, I fished the caramel chunks out, but saved the oil to re-use for 
cooking.

Overall, this variation is a knockout. The bitterness of the
grapefruit really stands out, but it's tempered by the
smooth, creamy panna cotta, and the caramel-coated almonds
were a perfect contrast. The other variations (vanilla with
berries and honey, and Thai basil with peppered strawberries)
sound great too.
