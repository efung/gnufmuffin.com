excerpt: "Continuing the quinoa theme, I tried out a crumble using a quinoa topping. It\'s billed as a gluten-free recipe, but it\'s extremely delicious. Like Cook\'s Illustrated\'s technique, the topping is baked separately so that it will stay crisp. I made a batch of this in a larger container a while ago,"

It's billed as a gluten-free recipe, but it's extremely delicious. Like Cook's Illustrated's technique, the topping is baked separately so that it will stay crisp. I made a batch of this in a larger container a while ago, and also made these individual ones in ramekins. Not much can go wrong in this. I used some questionable candied ginger slices that gave the fruit an off flavour, and you'll need to adjust the sugar depending on the ripeness of your pears. Pear crumbles are even tastier than apple ones so it's nice to have another recipe to fall back on.
