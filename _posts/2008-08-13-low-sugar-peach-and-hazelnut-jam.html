excerpt: "I decided to try using the no-sugar pectin to make this jam diabetic-friendly. To get the hazelnut flavour, I put toasted, chopped hazelnuts in a cheesecloth and added it to the jam mixture, as well as a quarter cup of Frangelico. Some of my peach chunks were quite large, I wonder what the food safety"

To get the hazelnut flavour, I put toasted, chopped hazelnuts in a cheesecloth and added it to the jam mixture, as well as a quarter cup of Frangelico. Some of my peach chunks were quite large, I wonder what the food safety issues are and why the directions tell you to crush finely? Is it extract natural pectin (probably not the case for peaches)? Instead of the called-for apple or white grape juice, I used unsweetened peach nectar. Why wouldn't they use a complementary flavour?<br /><br />This jam set quite firmly and yielded only four 250 mL jars. It was a little tangy as I didn't add any sugar at all. The hazelnut flavour is subtle and you probably wouldn't notice it if it weren't written on the label.
