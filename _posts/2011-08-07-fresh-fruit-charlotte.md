For a BBQ class to reunite our prenatal class post-birth, we
volunteered to make dessert. I had thought about something like the
[Summer Berry Pie](/2009/05/summer-berry-pie.html) but
wanted to try something more advanced, just for the challenge. 

I decided on the fruit charlotte recipe from [Advanced Bread and Pastry](/tag/advanced-bread-and-pastry/)
by Michael Suas. As research, I found two blog posts
by [hansjoakim](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/blog/hansjoakim)
describing his two experiences [[1]](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/11800/meat-murder)
and [[2]](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/18292/part-deux-loaf-and-pastry)
making the cake. I also found the [recipe](http://www.sfbi.com/pdfs/SFBINewsSUM07.pdf) (PDF) 
online in a SFBI newsletter.

Day 1

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021242727/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Berry Compote Layer"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/7/6001/6021242727_5005385b7d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Berry Compote Layer"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I started by making the berry layer. I used frozen
berries, thawed and liquified in a blender to make the puree, plus
fresh berries. These are all combined with a vanilla bean, sugar
and gelatin. I used a total of two sheets of Gelita Gold gelatin
(recipe calls for <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> oz gelatin) and it set
up a little too firmly; next time, I'd use one and a half sheets.
I didn't have a Flexipan (silicon) mold, so I used a smaller (6 or
7") cake ring placed on a Silpat and lined the inside with plastic
wrap. The completed compote is about 1 cm thick. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021797658/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Lemon Crémeux Layer"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/7/6024/6021797658_057ed5a953.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Lemon Crémeux Layer"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Next, I made the lemon <i>crémeux</i> (French for
creamy), basically a standard lemon curd. Once the berry layer was
frozen, I lifted it out still attached to the plastic film and
wrapped it tightly. I re-used the cake ring setup to freeze the
lemon layer. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021798574/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Ladyfinger Batter"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/7/6127/6021798574_6b8df17482.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Ladyfinger Batter"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Next, I made the ladyfinger batter. I didn't want
to run out of ladyfingers so I doubled the quantities. I didn't
have egg white powder, so I substituted cream of tartar. I also
omitted the trimoline because I didn't know what it was and the
quantity was so small. It turns out that it's just invert sugar
syrup, which I actually do have a container of. Anyway, potato
starch was one ingredient I didn't have on hand and needed to
purchase. It comes in a small resealable zipper lock packet, but
I've also seen larger quantities, e.g. Bob's Red Mill produces it.
I used a pretty big piping tip so these came out a bit chunky. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021246557/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Ladyfingers"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/7/6027/6021246557_2903f0f4b8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Ladyfingers"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I needed almost double the baking time in order
to fully brown the ladyfingers. I attribute this to the thickness
of my piped fingers. I let the baked band and discs sit overnight,
covered with a baking sheet. They came out a little moist (maybe
residual heat or wet interior) so I would just loosely cover it
with parchment or foil in the future. 

Day 2
=====

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021799394/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Pastry Cream"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/7/6012/6021799394_07de5a7478.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Pastry Cream"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In the early morning, I made the pastry cream as
directed, but substituted vanilla extract instead of a bean. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021247423/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Diplomat Cream"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/7/6134/6021247423_8329bf8d00.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Diplomat Cream"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After making a batch of whipped cream, I proceeded
to warm some of the pastry cream in the microwave, as well as melt
the bloomed gelatin (two and a half sheets of Gelita Gold). Once
these two were combined, I tempered the mixture with a bit of whipped
cream, then folded everything together. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021801888/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Assembly"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6015/6021801888_b27e064142.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Assembly"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

For assembly, I used an 8¾" cake ring, larger
than the 8" one called for in the recipe. I lined the base with a
ladyfinger disc and the sides with the bands. Using a brush, I
moistened the base with a kirschwasser syrup. Using a measuring
cup, I scooped about a cup of diplomat cream and smoothed it with
a small offset spatula 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021802710/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Assembly"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/7/6015/6021802710_6a560e7521.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Assembly"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Continuing the assembly, the frozen berry compote
layer is placed gently on the cream, and another cup of cream is
poured over. You need to work quickly or the mixture will set and
be harder to spread. The book recipe omits the step of placing the
second ladyfinger disc between the two frozen filling discs.
Fortunately, the cutaway diagram shows the correct layering. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/6021803412/" title="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Assembly"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/7/6022/6021803412_0d353cc49d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fresh Fruit Charlotte - Assembly"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Here is the final layering where the lemon layer
is placed on top. At this point, I ran out of diplomat cream. I
quickly made another batch of whipping cream, tempered half a sheet
of melted, bloomed gelatin with some warmed cream, and used it to
fill the cake. At this point, I put the assembled cake into the
fridge where it needed six hours to set up. 

The last step is to pile fresh berries on top,
and apply apricot glaze. I used blackberries, raspberries and
blueberries and strained strawberry-rhubarb jam as a glaze.
Unfortunately, no photo of the completed cake.  Here's two views
of a slice of cake:

The cake was absolutely delicious. The ladyfingers turned
soft and fluffy, and each layer was distinct and complementary. The
technique of freezing soft filling layers is clever and effective.
Highly recommended, and a cake I would definitely make again.
