The brownie base calls for nuts but I left them out for the sake of a taster's allergies. On top of that layer is a vanilla pastry cream combined with Cognac and whipped cream. A <a title="mint, citrus, vanilla">flavoured</a> transparent glaze is the finishing touch (somewhat lumpy when cooled). This turned out fine in an 8 3/4" cake ring; the 10" one called for in the recipe would have made a shorter cake. I felt there were too many raisins; one taster felt more Cognac in the cream would have been better. A pretty good cake, not as amazing as some other ones from this book, but it's also a lot less work.
