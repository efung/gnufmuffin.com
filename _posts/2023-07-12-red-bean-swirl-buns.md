A package of Shirakiku Fine Sweetened Red Bean Paste has been sitting
in my fridge for a few months now. I finally turned it into these
beautiful swirly buns.

The 
[recipe](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/best-home-cooks-kristina-cho/)
is from _Mooncakes and Milk Bread_ by Kristina Cho. The dough base
is the milk bread dough from her book. I was excited to practise 
the shaping technique which involves cutting slits, a twist, and a
coil! ([TikTok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@eatchofood/video/7117806368731548974?lang=en) demonstrating the process.)

I found that the dough gets very, very thin when you roll it to the
suggested dimensions. It was easy to work with though. My daughter
helped to spread the filling, and also to cut and shape. Don't skimp
on the red bean paste, you want enough in every bite.

Here they are after proofing. I love how the dough is opaque but thin
enough for the filling to show in some of the buns.

Tada! So nice with the shiny egg glaze. I skipped the sugar syrup
glaze that you can apply after baking.

For me, red bean paste brings back childhood memories. It's not
only familiar, but a taste that I truly love. Unfortunately, while
my daughter enjoyed shaping these, she wasn't that interested in tasting
them. If you can't finish them all in a few days, these buns froze well. 
We're going to make them again, but using sweetened black sesame paste 
next time!
