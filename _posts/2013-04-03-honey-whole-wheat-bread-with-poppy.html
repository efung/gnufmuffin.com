This recipe uses a poolish starter, and is pretty simple to make. The flavourings come from the zest of a whole lemon, a &frac14; cup of honey and several tablespoons of poppy seeds.<br /><br />On paper, it sounded delicious, but I can't say I enjoyed this bread. I appreciate the long, slow rises and steps to build flavour, but the poppy seeds add an overpowering aroma that doesn't appeal to me. I'm going to eat this as toast, with lots of PB or marmalade (defeating the goal of eating less sugar and fat!)
