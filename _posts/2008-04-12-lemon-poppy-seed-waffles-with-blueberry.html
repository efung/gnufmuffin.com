Instead of melted butter (because I was lazy), I used oil in the batter but did grease the waffle iron with butter. Also, I just mixed some sweetened blueberry puree with maple syrup rather than making the sauce. The waffles are nice and crisp, with a definite lemon and poppy seed flavour, nicely balanced. Would make this again.
