For Shabbat dinner, I made a coffee ice cream with chocolate shavings. While it turned out very tasty, it melted quite quickly, and I didn't like the little bits of chocolate. The flavour is quite intense, as there is both liqueur and reduced espresso making bittersweet contributions. If you are looking for a strongly flavoured coffee ice cream, this is a great recipe.
