Homemade granola is usually much tastier than store-bought but I have mixed opinions about this one. The sesame seeds tasted raw; maybe toasting them would have improved their flavour. I also misread the directions and left the dried cherries to bake in the oven. They turned out dry and burnt and Dr. S had to fish them all out. It was also hard to get large clumps, maybe pressing it together would have encouraged bigger pieces to form. Do make sure it is fully browned before you take it out of the oven, as the toasted almonds are delicious.
