The intro text says it dates from the Dinah's Cupboard days (circa 1987). The recipe employs an oil-based batter, enhanced with a bit of orange zest and juice. Apple wedges are embedded in layers in the batter, and a butterscotch sauce is drizzled on top afterwards. While this cake is deliciously moist and sweet, it didn't wow me particularly.
