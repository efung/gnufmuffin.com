We often get asked to bring dessert to dinner parties. This past
Saturday evening, I made two desserts from a used cookbook I acquired
recently: brownies (with and without walnuts) for the kids in
attendance, and this more grown-up walnut and apple layer cake.

The
[recipe](https://tishboyle.blogspot.ca/2011/02/walnut-layer-cake-with-apple-caramel.html)
consists of making three components, then assembly. First up, the
walnut cake. This is a sponge cake made with both ground walnuts
and almonds. Since yolks aren't needed, I purchased [a container
of pasteurized egg whites](http://burnbraefarms.com/en/products/cracked-eggs/naturegg-simply-egg-whites).
I can't remember whether I've ever used a product like this, but
my experience was pretty positive.  The pure egg whites were
homogeneous and liquid, and whipped up just like fresh ones would.

While the cake baked, I worked on the caramelized apples. Following
the advice of Tish Boyle in the linked recipe above, I didn't use
the juice of a whole lemon, but a teaspoon in total. An acid helps
[prevent
crystallization](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/555/how-does-adding-lemon-juice-to-sugar-make-better-caramel)
when [making a wet caramel from
scratch](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/14/how-to-cook-caramel)
but I didn't want to make the filling too sour.  I added a few
spoonfuls of water to make up for the reduced lemon juice. I didn't
let the molten syrup get to 374Â°F as it had already achieved a
golden brown colour before then. After adding the cream gradually,
I stirred in cubed Golden Delicious apples until they were soft.
Note that I followed the specified weight (680&nbsp;g) rather than 
the subjective description of "3 small apples".

The apple mixture is quite runny, so you're supposed to drain the
fruit and discard the caramel. However, I saved it in a squeeze
bottle, as I thought (correctly) that people would enjoy drizzling
it over their servings.

To ice the cake, this recipe calls for a simple cream cheese frosting
flavoured with an apple liqueur. I used apfelkorn instead of Calvados,
and also reduced the amount of heavy cream, as I wanted something
that wouldn't be too soft.

One other time-saving purchase, was fried candied walnuts from T&T 
Supermarket. They're found in the bakery section of the store, and
are a pricey, but incredibly satisfying treat. I used these to garnish 
the top of the cake.

Overall, everyone really enjoyed the flavours of this cake. Echoing Boyle's 
assessment in the recipe headnote, I also found the cake to be a bit tough 
and dry, so the extra apple caramel was a welcome accompaniment. Unlike
her opinion of the frosting, I found it sweet enough for my taste.

If I ever make this again, I would consider splitting the cake into three
layers, and then increasing the amount of apples, so that there would be a
greater fruit-to-cake ratio.
