excerpt: "Last week, we started by making the hamantaschen fillings. For the apricot one, we used a mix of unsulphured and sulphured dried apricots. You can use the latter if you don\'t want a dark colour. Instead of orange juice, we substituted water to cut down on the sugar, as well as reducing the granulated"

For the apricot one, we used a mix of unsulphured and sulphured dried apricots. You can use the latter if you don't want a dark colour. Instead of orange juice, we substituted water to cut down on the sugar, as well as reducing the granulated sugar also. Since the cookie itself is a sweet and rich, I wanted a nice contrasting tart flavour in the fillings. For the other filling, we followed the sour cherry recipe but substituted dried <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/ark-product.jsp?id=102">Elephant heart plums</a> for the raisins. <br /><br />Each batch of filling is enough for three or four batches of the cookie dough recipe. So we baked a lot of cookies over the last week. All the water in the cream cheese and butter results in a pastry that puffs up in the oven, so be sure to roll thinly and pinch firmly. Because it's so rich, a smaller cookie cutter made a more manageable serving.<br /><br />Please enjoy a video we put together:<br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PqfQJCSHVGo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
