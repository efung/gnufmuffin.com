Unfortunately, this recipe was a letdown. The cupcake batter featured lots of chocolate and the filling is a separate icing-like mixture. The 40-minute bake time was way too long (and I didn't find the linked recipe until afterwards) and resulted in dried out cupcakes. These are too rich, with a weird combination of cake and crumbly-creamy peanut filling. Flick later passed them off as "brownies" to some other tasters!
