To start, Chef spent time explaining the ingredients we were going to use in tonight's class for the cherries. He suggested we take store-bought maraschino cherries and let them soak in a flavoured syrup or alcohol for a few months to imbue them with even more flavour. Fresh, pitted cherries were also a possibility. Chef pointed out the importance of blotting the cherries dry so that their juices wouldn't colour the <a title="a smooth cooked sugar icing">fondant</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/286757748/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/114/286757748_fd524b116f_t.jpg" class="inlineright" width="100" height="75" alt="Chocolate Dipped Maraschino Cherries" /></a> This led into a discussion of how to make fondant, or, rather, why bother making it. Fondant is tricky to get right, and it's possible to buy it pre-made in cake supply shops. For extra shine, Chef said to add egg whites, while water is usually added to get a spreadable or dippable consistency. A neat trick he taught us when colouring fondant (say, for <span style="font-style:italic;">petit fours</span>) is to go successively from light to dark (e.g. yellow to pink to red to brown). That way, you can get several colours from one batch of fondant.<br /><br />When the icing was warmed to a loose consistency, we dipped the cherries into the fondant, coating them almost to the stem, then placed them on a tray prepared with a layer of icing sugar. Otherwise, the fondant-coated fruit sticks to the parchment making removal difficult. After tempering a batch of chocolate in a deep bowl, we dipped the cherries into the chocolate and set them on a clean sheet of parchment to set.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/286757819/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/114/286757819_2ac82fc0f7_t.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="100" height="75" alt="Caramelized Almond Drops" /></a> For our second product, we made almond clusters similar to the ones from last week. Chef mixed egg whites, granulated sugar and almond slivers together, then baked them in a moderate oven until they were dry and browned. After breaking up the clumps, we stirred in melted tempered chocolate and dropped spoonfuls onto parchment.<br /><br />As you can see from the photos, my partner and I have still not got the tempering process down. I hope <a href="http://www.cdn-timeandtemp.com/products/proaccurate/#q2-450">my new thermometer</a> will help in this regard. Incidentally, <a href="http://degreeskitchen.com/">Degrees Kitchen Store</a> near Yonge and Eglinton carries both CDN and Thermoworks thermometers. The latter go for C$100 (!) which is about what you'd pay if buying from the US plus shipping.
