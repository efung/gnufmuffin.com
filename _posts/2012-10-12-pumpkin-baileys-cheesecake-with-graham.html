excerpt: "For a recent Friday night dinner, I decided to take some of the roasted kabocha and pumpkin we had, and turn it into a cheesecake, as it\'s been a long time since I\'ve made a cheesecake or anything with pumpkin. This CI recipe looked good: a pecan-enhanced crust, and the promise of a smooth creamy texture.Instead"

This CI recipe looked good: a pecan-enhanced crust, and the promise of a smooth creamy texture.<br /><br />Instead of having to blot a can of pumpkin puree to remove moisture, I used a mixture of kabocha (which is quite dry) and pumpkin. The only other deviation I had to make was with the heavy cream and bourbon. I had neither, so used a mixture of table cream and Bailey's. This turned out to be a mistake. The texture was a bit too wet, and the cream liqueur was not a good match for the pumpkin and spices. Still, it was a pretty good pumpkin cheesecake, maybe something to make once a year.
