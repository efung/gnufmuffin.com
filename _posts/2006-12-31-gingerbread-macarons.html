I noticed that this recipe uses icing sugar and ground almonds in a similar proportion (about 2:1) as <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/2005/10/french_chocolat.html">David Lebovitz'</a> recipe. However, the recipe from <a href="http://www.alacuisine.org/alacuisine/2004/11/macarons_imbb_1.html">Clement</a> (which <a title="who blogs about macarons">everyone</a> seems to start with) uses a 1:1 proportion. I've found Clement's to be much harder to work with, so my standard macaron batter from now on will be Sherry Yard's. I had no trouble with piping and all of the macarons came out with smooth tops. If you overbake, the colour will be a bit darker and the shells a bit crisper. The Fuji apples in the compote stayed pretty firm after caramelizing. After whizzing them to break them down, there were still detectable bits of apple. The mixture seemed a bit watery, but thickened while on ice. <br /><br />The instructions are very detailed so this shouldn't be too difficult for a determined baker. The results are well worth the effort: the macaron shells are tinted a nice shade of brown by the molasses and have a gentle hint of spice, while the apple compote is both complementary and contrasting. Do try these.
