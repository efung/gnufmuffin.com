excerpt: "The recipe calls for an unconventional way to line a fluted tart pan: form the dough into a log, then slice out pieces and pat them into the tin. I don't understand how this is easier or better than just rolling it. It certainly wasn't more tender; I do like the addition of lemon zest and vanilla seeds"

I don't understand how this is easier or better than just rolling it. It certainly wasn't more tender; I do like the addition of lemon zest and vanilla seeds though. The frangipane filling was way too sweet and buttery and came out quite wet. His quantities are suspect in my opinion. I took this tart onto a <a href="http://www.flyporter.com/">plane</a> in my checked luggage, schlepping it to Dr. S' family's house, where it was well received. I've made better tarts with better frangipanes. Maybe Jamie Oliver's strengths don't lie in the pastry kitchen?
