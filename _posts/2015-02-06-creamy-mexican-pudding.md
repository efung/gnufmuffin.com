Mexican *chocolate* pudding, that is. The Cook's Illustrated website
offered this complex, "adult" variation with flavourings like
vanilla, cinnamon, espresso and chili. I love these things
in [chocolate chili ice cream](/2007/06/chocolate-chili-ice-cream.html)
so I was excited to try it in a pudding.

On Friday morning, I followed the
[recipe](http://recipetools.gotdns.com/johnsmags/mags/CI/112/CI-112.html#Creamy_Mexican_Pudding),
and assembled all the dry ingredients. We actually had chipotle
chili powder: our spice drawer is pretty complete. It's important
to thoroughly mix the cornstarch with sugar, to reduce clumping.
We didn't have heavy cream or whole milk: I substituted with
half-and-half, and 2% milk.

Once the cream and yolks are incorporated, they start to dissolve
the dry ones, and I slowly poured the milk in while constantly whisking.
This tempering method helps to reduce lumps. Once heated, the mixture
appears unchanged at first, but as it gets hotter, it starts to thicken
very quickly. The whole process probably took 20 minutes or so,
and would have been faster had I already had chopped chocolate
available.

Everyone, including my son, loved this slightly spicy chocolate
pudding. It was creamy, not too rich or disgustingly thick, and very
satisfying. The great thing about making pudding from scratch is
that it's not a lot of work at all, and this recipe can be made 
in the morning, and be ready in time for dinner.
