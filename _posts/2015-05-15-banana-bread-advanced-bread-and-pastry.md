Yet another banana bread… This time the recipe comes from Michael Suas'
book, [Advanced Bread and
Pastry](/tag/advanced-bread-and-pastry/). Sadly, this recipe
offered nothing new in terms of technique or flavour.

I made two loaves of the “test” batch measurements. The batter is
straightforward and there are no gotchas. “Scoring” the loaf with an
oil-dipped scraper is something I learned back in a [pound cake
class](/2005/09/cake-1-pound-cakes.html), and worked well here. 
Unfortunately, this quick bread is not particularly remarkable,
with a mild banana flavour and slightly damp crumb.
