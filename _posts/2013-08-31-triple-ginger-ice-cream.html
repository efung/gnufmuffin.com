excerpt: "Just before we left for our mini-vacation and trip to Montreal, I made a batch of ice cream, following this Cook\'s Illustrated recipe. Let\'s just say, it is very, VERY, VERY gingery. Too much, even for me. I want a bold flavour, but this was just too much. I would greatly reduce the candied ginger"

Let's just say, it is very, VERY, <b>VERY</b> gingery. Too much, even for me. I want a bold flavour, but this was just too much. I would greatly reduce the candied ginger next time, and mince it very finely. I didn't use the full amount of egg yolks, and used 10% cream, which made for a lighter texture. The recipe is a bit fussy with detailed instructions on how to achieve a smooth texture by minimizing ice crystal formation, achieved by freezing the mixture as fast as possible. In my house, the ice cream is eaten slowly, so even a month later, I'm still enjoying a small bowl at a time (their suggestion is a storage life of 5 days).
