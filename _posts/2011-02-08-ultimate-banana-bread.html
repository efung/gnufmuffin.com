excerpt: "There are at least four other banana breads in this blog (here, another, one more, and my previous favourite). I make some versions more often than others, but it's like bran muffins or chocolate chip cookies for me: I'm still on the lookout for a recipe that improves on all the previous ones. I have"

I make some versions more often than others, but it's like bran muffins or chocolate chip cookies for me: I'm still on the lookout for a recipe that improves on all the previous ones. I have not reached the <a href="http://www.rootsandgrubs.com/2006/05/11/the-best-recipe/">satisficing</a> point just yet.<br /><br />Armed with a half dozen, very ripe, deeply browned bananas, I set out to try this CI recipe. The unusual (for the rest of the world, but not for CI) step comes right at the beginning: microwaving bananas to separate the juice from the pulp. After that's done, the liquid is concentrated and added back to the batter. This obviously adds extra time and work to the recipe, but it is the key step that allows a full five bananas to be incorporated into one loaf. <br /><br />This is quite a delicious banana bread, intensely flavoured and moist. I only got to eat one slice, so I'm going to make this again and have it all to myself. As soon as this bunch of bananas gets ripe.
