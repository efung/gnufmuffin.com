This cookie called for "Major Grey" chutney, which I had never heard
of before.  Wikipedia
[says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Grey%27s_Chutney) it
usually has raisins, but none of the ones I found included it.  To
avoid over-stocking on this condiment, I stopped shopping at three
jars.

The recipe is from _Fabulous Modern Cookies_ and I've had my eye on 
it since I got the book. Curry powder is used in the dough, and it's
rolled in finely chopped cashews, how good does that sound? I quickly
weighed each portion (12 grams!) to ensure the cookies were evenly sized.
The gently curved end of a bamboo spatula was the perfect tool to re-form
the thumbprints after the cookies were partially baked.

So what chutney did I use? I opened a jar of Brooklyn Delhi's Mango
Chutney Major Grey's Style, and rejected it for being too runny.
Next, was Patak's: they sell **three** [chutneys](https://pataks.ca/categories-products/chutneys-pickles) but Fiesta Farms did not have the Major
Grey one, so I settled for their sweet version. It was thicker, and had
bits of fruit in it. Lastly, the Sharwoods jar will have to wait
for a different project.

This recipe makes a lot of cookies, something like four dozen. Each 
are two bites, and the flavour is complex and very satisfying. Even
Dr. S, who recoils whenever I stray too far in the savoury direction,
gave them a nod.
