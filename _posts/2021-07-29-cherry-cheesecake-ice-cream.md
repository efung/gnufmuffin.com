We've been buying black cherries for a few weeks now and they've
come down in price from $9/lb to $5 and to $3. While snacking on a cold,
firm, sweet cherry is hard to beat, the fruit is often a bit mushy,
or starts to bruise. Preserving them in alcohol is a handy way to
extend their life, and enhance their flavour.

There's a lot of uses for brandied cherries, but I wanted to try 
the cherry cheesecake ice cream recipe from the 
[Van Leeuwen Ice Cream Cookbook](https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/product/van-leeuwen-cookbook/).
About three weeks ago, I pitted a bunch of cherries that were past 
their prime, then give them a quick hot bath in sugar and alcohol. 
I embellished the recipe a bit, adding a few different kinds of liqueur
and some additional warm spices.

Once those cherries were nice and boozy, I was ready to continue.
The recipe calls for a standard base (cream, milk, eggs)
with the addition of cream cheese added to the strained, hot
custard. A hand blender helps to ensure there are no lumps.
During churning, the drained, chopped fruit is added.

Unfortunately, this ice cream was disappointing. There is hardly
any cherry flavour, and I found the boozy fruit to be too
bitter. Some potential improvements: replacing some of the milk with
cherry juice; adding some yogurt to boost the tanginess of the 
cream cheese flavour; garnishing servings with graham cracker
crumbs.
