I was out of the country for half of June, partly because I caught
and recovered from COVID while abroad. Now that I've returned, I
didn't hesitate to get back into baking with summer's fruit. For a
recent cottage weekend we were invited to, I contributed [lemon
bars](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2020/04/lemoniest-lemon-bars.html) and
these hand pies.

A long time ago, I made [pie lollipops](/2009/10/apple-and-raspberry-pie-lollipops.html), which are a kind of hand pie, I suppose. 
The May/June 2022 Cook's Illustrated [article](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/5067-tender-buttery-flaky-fruit-pie-but-make-it-portable) 
and recipe yields larger treats, but are just as fun to behold and eat. 

I misread the directions about cutting the butter sticks into long planks
and just cubed mine, before bashing it with the flour inside a large
Ziploc bag. The rough puff dough turned out fine anyway. It was
fairly easy to fold and roll but did shrink back quite a bit, but
patience and resting is the key here.

As for the filling, we have
a small [serviceberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelanchier) tree 
on our property, and this year, we harvested the fruit as soon as they
started to darken and turn ripe. I followed the magazine's cherry filling
recipe, using a scant 2 cups of fresh serviceberries, and a bit of
frozen blueberries. There wasn't a lot of liquid in the mixture, so it 
thickened nicely while cooling.

Shaping the hand pies was the fun part: you paint an egg wash border
and make the pies as you would ravioli. The directions call for two
tablespoons per pie, but I had leftover so I think you could get
away with a bit more than that. I crimped the edges with a fork
after trimming to ensure a good seal.

We ate these a few hours after they came out of the oven, and they 
were still warm. Hardly any of them leaked. The pastry was beautifully
tender and flaky, but sturdy. The filling was not too sweet or runny.
Highly recommended. I want to make more with peaches and cherries 
and plums and blueberries!
