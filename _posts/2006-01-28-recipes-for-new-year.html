Their books are part travel memoir and part recipe collection. Not a general purpose baking book nor a resource for techniques, but a nice glimpse into baking across cultures.<br /><dt><span style="font-style:italic;">Gordon Ramsay's Just Desserts</span><br /><dd>I'm told he is a &ldquo;celebrity chef&rdquo; and has some kind of TV show. Heavy emphasis on fruit in this book. Lots of photographs throughout, many step-by-step guides.<br /><dt><span style="font-style:italic;">Plaisirs sucrés</span> de Pierre Hermé<br /><dd>Hermé has somewhat of a cult following. This edition is a cute pocket-sized hardcover with very tiny print. Many of the recipes are beyond my skills right now and it will be a challenge just to translate not only the French text, but all of the cooking terms too. His imagination and creativity is certainly displayed here.<br /><dt><span style="font-style:italic;">Celebrate With Chocolate</span> by Marcel Desaulniers<br /><dd>Very detailed instructions written in a conversational tone. Desaulniers has a lot of fun describing the origin of each recipe and even the names are outlandish. The majority of these desserts are complicated and require a stand mixer. A nice touch is including notes on alterations, equipment, flavours and suggestions for how to make each recipe over several days.<br /><dt><span style="font-style:italic;">Caprial's Desserts</span> by Caprial Pence &amp; Melissa Carey<br /><dd>Very accessible recipes, with ideas for variations included with each one. They stay away from fancy and fussy creations, so everything is very homey. There are some nice step-by-step photo illustrations, including one on how to make a parchment pastry bag. Note that the recipes assume you are using a stand mixer.<br /><dt><span style="font-style:italic;">Fine Cooking</span>, February/March 2006<br /><dd>I heard about this magazine from my aunt and bought this issue after reading a great recommendation on <a href="http://www.rootsandgrubs.com/">Roots and Grubs</a>. It's glossy, full-colour, packed with advertisements and authored by cookbook writers. They do feature ingredient and product comparisons, some scientific investigations and even nutritional analysis of all recipes. Sort of a mass market <span style="font-style:italic;">Cook's Illustrated</span>.</dl>
