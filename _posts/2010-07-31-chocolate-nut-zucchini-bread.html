So, along with everyone else who grows zucchini this time of year, I went looking for bread recipes. I liked this one from Fine Cooking and tried making a double batch of it, with a few adaptations. First, I used giant sunburst pattypan squash, and peeled their tough skins. I followed the directions to sugar and drain the flesh. Quite a bit of water came out. Instead of laboriously chopping chocolate, I used the same weight of cocoa powder. Lastly, my final alteration was replacing some of the eggs with egg whites (leftover from some other project).<br /><br />Given all these changes, it wouldn't be fair for me to judge the quality of this recipe based on the turnout of these loaves. But this bread actually turned out alright. It was a little dry and spongy, as to be expected since my version lacked the cocoa butter and egg yolks that are present in the original. But it was fairly moist, with a mild chocolate flavour. I don't know that I would make this again, but it's not bad.
