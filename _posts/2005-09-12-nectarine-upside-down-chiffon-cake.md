[Recipe](http://littlefrenchbakery.com/blog/nectarine-upside-down-chiffon-cake) from _Baking with Julia_ by Dorie Greenspan. _Notes_: This cake turned out really well. Baking time was extended by about 20 minutes (with the pan covered in foil) as it wasn't done in the middle. A bit soggy near the nectarine part, maybe I left it in the pan to cool too long. Chiffon cake is nice and light, nice contrast with streusel and fruit.
