Do you remember the [2019 New York Times cookie special](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/dining/christmas-cookies.html)? Well, it's back this year in the form of [24 Days of Cookies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/30/dining/cookie-calendar.html). There was no fold-out spread in this past Sunday's newspaper,
so maybe it's online only. We decided to make holiday cookie boxes again, so
we started to bake one cookie a day this week.

We picked this tahini cookie to start ([recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022759-tahini-thumbprints-cookies-with-dulce-de-leche)). On its own, the sesame paste
can be quite bitter so it needs other strong flavours to balance it out. 
I doubled down and decided to use a _smoky_ tahini
made by [Parallel Brothers](https://parallelbrothers.com/).

The dough was quite oily, so I was reluctant to pick up the portioned
balls and roll them. In the end, they turned out fine, but a little misshapen.
If you're going for presentation, then by all means, get your palms greasy
and make them more uniform.

I loved the combination of smoky, bitter, sweet, and salty in this cookie. It's 
just a bit out of the ordinary, and exactly the kind of delightful discovery
I want in a cookie box.
