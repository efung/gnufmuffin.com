excerpt: "To use up some yogurt I had (and to make a fine accompaniment for the white chicken chili I made for dinner tonight), I tried this cornbread from a book dedicated to the subject. It's a pretty funny read, as the author had four goals in writing the book, the third of which is, &ldquo;Find a wife.&rdquo;"

It's a pretty funny read, as the author had four goals in writing the book, the third of which is, &ldquo;Find a wife.&rdquo; I used whole eggs rather than whites and didn't put any of the optional salt in. This variation is so simple, you can mix it up and finish baking it in just about a half hour. It's got a toothy chew (from stone-ground coarse cornmeal) and is bland enough to serve as a side.
