I decided to incorporate a peanut butter filling into the cookie, as it is a natural companion to chocolate. When I couldn't find a single recipe that had everything I was looking for, I used separate recipes, both incorporating milk chocolate.<br /><br />The cookies were easy to make according to the recipe. I chilled the dough briefly before and after rolling to ensure it would not be too soft. My rolled dough was too thick and made for heavy cookies, so next time, I'll make sure to roll it as thinly as suggested, perhaps rolling the cookie rounds after cutting them out. I also used a cutter that was about 2&frac12;" in diameter. This made for pretty large cookies that were a bit rich for one serving. Using a smaller cutter, then rolling them out thinner and a bit larger, should solve both problems.<br /><br />I melted the chocolate in the microwave for the filling. This ensured there would be no lumps. Filling the cookies is easiest if you get the filling at just the right consistency, not too runny and not too firm. You want to be able to squish the two halves together and have it ooze right to the edge.<br /><br />These were pretty successful, and I think I'll make these again with the changes I noted above.
