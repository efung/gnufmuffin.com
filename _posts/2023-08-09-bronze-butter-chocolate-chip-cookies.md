I had a little extra spending money this month, and browsed one of
my favorite stores, [Good Egg](https://goodegg.ca/). A newish book 
of cookies caught my eye due to the ingredients used in some
of the recipes: celery, garam masala, red curry paste! As I am
the kind of baker who gets excited about 
[beet goat cheese ice cream](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2015/07/beet-goat-cheese-honey-pistachio-ice-cream.html), I knew I had to buy 
[Fabulous Modern Cookies](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781682686591) by
Chris Taylor and Paul Arguin.

The first cookie I tried was the bronze butter chocolate chip cookie 
[recipe](https://www.eva-bakes.com/bronze-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies/). 
"Bronze butter" is the authors' name 
for browned butter made with added milk powder solids, yielding more
caramelized, nutty flavor. Of course, I keep milk powder on hand
for bread baking and for the various recipes in [Milk
Bar](/tag/milk-bar/).

These cookies were good, but didn't warrant spending the extra time
and money (powdered milk is $$$) to make bronzed butter. I'm not
disappointed by this start though, and look forward to making many
more unusual cookies from the book.
