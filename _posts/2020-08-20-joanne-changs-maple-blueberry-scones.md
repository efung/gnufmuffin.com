I first heard of Joanne Chang's _Flour_ bakery in Boston from a
[muffin](/2007/12/chocolate-and-ginger-bake-shop-muffins.html)
article in _Fine Cooking_ in the mid-2000s. While I have never been
to any of her bakery locations, I do see her name pop up from time
to time in food articles. So when a Sunday Magazine
[article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/magazine/this-giant-blueberry-scone-is-self-care-with-butter-and-flour.html)
told her story, I paid close attention. The blueberry scones looked
and sounded so good, I knew I had to make them.

The NY Times Cooking portal has the [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021206-joanne-changs-maple-blueberry-scones). I've made at least three other blueberry [scones](/tag/scones/)
in the past but this one is different than all the rest. It's made with butter, but it's incorporated
like the way you'd made pie dough, blitzing some of it in the food processor, then leaving some of it
in pea-sized lumps. There's a choice of tangy dairy products, but some ingredients still might
not be regular staple items.

Anyway, I made these twice. The first time, at my mother-in-law's house, I
made a bunch of substitutions like whole-wheat pastry flour, baking them
in a gas oven at my sister-in-law's, using Greek yogurt, and skipping the 
icing. At my own home this week, I made the batter with crème fraîche, 
letting the batter rest overnight.

The next morning, I baked them off, and made sure to make the glaze this time.
What incredibly delicious scones these are. Don't be fooled by the whole wheat flour:
there's still plenty of fat (which is the unavoidable secret to getting
tender scones), so it's not a healthy breakfast. Who cares, I ate two of these
that morning. They're very tender and a little crumbly, with a nice balance of
fruit. An excellent recipe, one worthy of repeat bakings.
