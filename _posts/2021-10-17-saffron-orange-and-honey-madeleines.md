While I had the Ottolenghi & Goh book _Sweet_ out, I flipped through
it to find something to make as a hostess gift to bring to a dinner
we were invited to. And this madeleine recipe, with its saffron
flavouring and pistachio decoration, seemed like something that
would be appreciated by our hosts.

The [recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/saffron-orange-honey-madeleines)
is simpler in some ways than most madeleine recipes. No mixer, and no long
refrigeration. Instead, the ingredients are blitzed in a food processor, then
the portioned batter is chilled for just one hour. For the orange zest, I grated
a few clementines.

I hadn't made madeleines in a long time, and forgot how little batter fills 
each mold. Mine turned out pretty well, not evenly browned like the photograph
in the book, but they all released from the pan and took on the nice shell shape.
We brushed one side with wildflower honey, and rolled them in lines of finely chopped pistachios.

Eaten fresh out of the oven, and even up to two days later, these
little cakes (cookies?) were heavenly. The saffron and citrus marry
so well together, and the honey glaze was the perfect amount of
sweetness. Highly recommended.
