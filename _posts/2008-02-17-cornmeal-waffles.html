It's got toasted wheat germ in it, but the other ingredients are typical for a waffle. I used my gluten-free flour mix in place of the all-purpose, but I think the wheat germ might prevent this from being a totally gluten-free waffle. The batter was runny and the first batch stuck to the griddle. By this time, the batter had thickened and made nicer waffles. I got sixteen regular sized ones. The corn crunchiness is nice, but the waffles' flavour is otherwise unremarkable.
