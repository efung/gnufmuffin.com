It's also rare to see a cookie recipe calling for IQF cherries, so my curiosity was piqued.<br /><br />I started with the cherry dough, omitting the food colouring, and substituting Kirschwasser for the cherry extract. The recipe doesn't say whether to drain the thawed cherries: I kept the liquid. Rolling the dough into a 10&times;18" rectangle wasn't too difficult, as the dough is very soft. Use a measuring tape or ruler as the suggested dimensions will help you produce the specified yield. The chocolate dough was even easier. Just remember to melt the chocolate during your <i>mise en place</i> as it needs to be cool before incorporating into the dough.<br /><br />The author gives very detailed instructions for how to roll the individual doughs but only says to "carefully invert" the chocolate onto the cherry dough. A large rectangle of soft dough is not the easiest to flip without it breaking. Once it's flipped, it's impossible to align the rectangles. I ended up trimming the overlap and patching it onto any uncovered parts. Make sure to press tightly as you roll to avoid having any air gaps in the spiral.<br /><br />After the chill in the refrigerator, I took out the log and trimmed the edges, and ended up with a cylinder exactly 8 inches long. Cutting each slice into approximately a 3/8" width, I ended up with just over 24 cookies. These spirals don't puff in the oven, so it's fine to place them close together.<br /><br />The finished cookies are soft and buttery, like a richly flavoured shortbread. Although the pink dough was speckled with bits of real fruit, the cherry flavour wasn't that noticeable. I like the idea of this cookie, but would try with perhaps an orange flavour next time?
