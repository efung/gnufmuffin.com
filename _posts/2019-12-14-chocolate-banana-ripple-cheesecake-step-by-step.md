For Friday night dinner, with family visiting from Montreal, I made a superb
dessert (in my humble opinion, but also everyone who tasted it). It was high
effort, but also high reward. Read on to see how I made it.

The recipe is from Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh's [_Sweet_](/tag/sweet-ottolenghi/), a cookbook
I am very slowly working through. 

## Crust
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49267078941/in/photostream/" title="Chocolate Banana Ripple Cheesecake"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49267078941_912f63ce16_c.jpg" width="800" height="799" alt="Chocolate Banana Ripple Cheesecake"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The base is graham cracker crumbs, cocoa powder, butter, and walnuts.
I made sure to finely chop the nuts so that they wouldn't stand out
too much. My brand of graham crumbs had "honey" in their name, so I
cut back on any added sugar.

## Bananas

I sliced them on a sharp bias, and only used enough to barely cover the bottom. I didn't
want too much soggy fruit.

## Filling

There are two components: a banana ganache, made by adding mashed
fruit to a regular chocolate ganache, and the cream cheese component,
which also has melted white chocolate in it. I don't keep any white
chocolate on hand usually, and just bought the Baker's stuff at the
supermarket.  

I opted for six dollops of the chocolate mixture, spaced around the edge, 
plus one more in the centre. When spooning it on the white batter, I let
it fall from on high, so that it would sink deeper into the tin, avoiding
a shallow layer of chocolate that wouldn't marble as nicely.

## Marbling

Using a small sharp paring knife to draw long S-curves, I tried
to uniformly swirl the chocolate and plain batters together.

## After baking

Aside from the ganache parts opening up into a crack, the cheesecake turned out beautifully. I let
it cool overnight on the counter, with a tea towel draped loosely on top, before putting it into
the fridge for the day.

## Verdict

This cake was a huge crowd pleaser. Everyone commented on how amazing it tasted.

I like most baked goods made with banana, but am more particular about bananas
in other desserts. This recipe is a home run. I love the crunch and complementary
flavour of nuts in the crust, the unexpected layer of fruit at the bottom, and
how the banana ganache is both a visual and flavour contrast to the main cheesecake.
