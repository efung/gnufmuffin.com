We stayed in a neighbour's apartment, and I brought my mixer and springform pan in my luggage just in case. It's a little slow working in someone else's kitchen, trying to find mixing bowls, measuring cups, etc. The zester I had access to was very dull, nowhere near the awesome grating power of a Microplane. The cake tested clean coming out of the oven at the given time, but it was still quite wet when we sliced into it. Everyone really enjoyed the rich chocolate flavour, and the tender, moist texture. After an overnight chill in the fridge, it tasted even better. This is a definite winner, and would be suitable for those who are gluten-free or dairy-free too, Jewish or not.<br /><br />P.S. I was browsing cookbooks on S's mom's shelf and was delighted to find this recipe verbatim in <a href="http://www.panachecookbook.com/home.htm">this Montreal cookbook</a>!
