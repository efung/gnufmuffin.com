Our third cookie this week (we're baking from the [24 Days of Cookies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/30/dining/cookie-calendar.html) calendar) was a peanut butter cookie,
enhanced in this version with peanut butter chips and whole nuts.
It was impossible not to like these, as they were sweet, 
soft, and very peanutty.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022704-peanut-butter-cookies)
is by Genevieve Ko (she is the co-author of [The Sweet Spot](/tag/thesweetspot/)
with Pichet Ong, among many other cookbooks). I'll let Dr. S talk about this
recipe as she was the one that made it:

> We didn't have _salted_ natural peanut butter, so we substituted
> salted butter for the unsalted instead. I found the cookies quite sweet,
> too sweet for my liking, but they're very delicious. The peanut
> butter chips are fun, but maybe reducing the overall sugar might
> mess up the cookie?

Well, there you have it. A good all-round cookie, but too sweet. I would tend
to agree. Unless you have a very sweet tooth, maybe reduce both the sugar and chips
a little bit, and now you have a perfect peanut butter cookie.
