After our annual apple-picking trip netted us 20+ pounds of apples,
my first project was apple butter. I did it the easy way this time:
letting the slow cooker gently cook and reduce the fruit puree.

The [recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/10/slow-cooker-apple-butter-recipe.html)
I used is from Serious Eats. There is a huge variation in ingredients and instructions
online: some do all the cooking in a crockpot, others do some pre-cooking
in the oven or on the stove. Some use a huge quantity of sugar, others much less.

It made sense to cook down the apples in a pot first, as the higher
heat would speed up the process. Once the fruit is soft, you puree
them with an immersion blender, then do the reducing and caramelization
in the slow cooker. My apples were all Golden Delicious with a few
Asian pear fridge orphans thrown in. I halved the sugar (using only dark brown,
omitting the white) and the only spice came from a half teaspoon
of cinnamon.

The recipe calls for about 8 hours of cooking, but we let it go for
about 10. The colour was a pretty deep caramel, but the consistency
was pretty loose. Next time, I'll experiment with leaving the lid
slightly open. Flavour-wise, I loved the intense, apple concentration
but wished it were a bit thicker.
