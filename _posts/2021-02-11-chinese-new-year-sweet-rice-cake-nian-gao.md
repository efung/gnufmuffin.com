I tell everyone that I never repeat any recipe in my baking 
experiments, but it's not literally true. Some items are so
tasty, that they make it into a regular rotation at our house,
but I don't write about them here. However, there are things
that I won't make more than once a year (croissants come to mind).
This week's 年糕 (_nian gao_) is something I doubt I'd make
for any other reason than annual tradition.

During Chinese New Year, one of the sweets at the table is literally
called "year cake". Its batter is made from glutinous rice flour
(also known as sticky rice flour) and brown sugar (but no eggs),
then steamed until it's set. The texture is a distinctive chewy
consistency, and slices are often dipped in an egg wash, then fried
until golden.

The kids and I had planned a gift basket, filled with fruit, snacks, and
a restaurant meal for my parents. I thought a traditional _nian gao_
might be appreciated. And, given my past experience, I didn't want
to have so much leftover, so I made a half batch from this
[recipe](https://thewoksoflife.com/nian-gao-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-29503)
courtesy of Woks of Life. (Note that their recipe scaling feature only scales 
the quantities in the **ingredient list** but not in the directions.)

The authors admit the recipe isn't quite traditional, since they
add orange zest, ginger, molasses, and other flavourings to their
batter. I think mine turned out perfectly, which pleased me as it
was the first time in my life I've tried to make it.  You definitely
want to slice up the firm cake when it's cold, then fry it until
it's warmed through and softened. As I mentioned before, you can
dip each little piece in egg first, but it's not necessary.

I gotta say that I didn't find this really tasty, even with the
Western take on the flavour, nor did it evoke any nostalgic fondness
for my childhood.  Maybe it's something I'll make for others, and
not myself!
