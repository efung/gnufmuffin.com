Halving the recipe, I baked the cake in an 8" square pan, adding an extra 10 minutes to the baking time. A whole tablespoon of baking powder gave the cake a lot of lift but I found it to be slightly dense and rubbery, not like a pound cake, but similar to other oil-based cakes. For the topping, I used Meyer lemon marmalade instead of orange. The citrus and salty top is a very tasty idea but the addition of marmalade to the batter itself would have made it even better. A nice snack cake.
