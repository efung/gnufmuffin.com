The short story: vodka. A <a href="http://www.americastestkitchen.com/ibb/posts.aspx?postID=215231">discussion</a> with the recipe's author is insightful reading. Traditional techniques and recipes aren't things that I cherish or adhere to, especially if newer discoveries provide better or more consistent results. While I have had a lot of experience attempting to make pie dough, I can't say that I have been all that successful. I made the crust substituting Tenderflake lard for vegetable shortening. It is indeed very soft and easy to work with, but still cracked along the edges. The filling is a little different: the apples and cranberries are precooked separately, then layered to keep them distinct. What a wonderful pie! Soft, flaky, tender pastry enclosing a sweet-tart fruit filling. This crust will become my standard pie crust, although the use of vodka certainly increases the food cost significantly!
