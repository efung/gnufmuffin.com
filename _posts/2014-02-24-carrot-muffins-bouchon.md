It's rare that I come across a muffin that really impresses me, but
these carrot muffins from [Bouchon Bakery](/tag/Bouchon%20Bakery/)
were outstanding.

Like every muffin in the cookbook, the
[recipe](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/03/29/175599684/homemade-peeps-and-more-easter-treats-a-la-thomas-keller#muffins)
yields half a dozen muffins. It made more sense to me to double it up,
to avoid awkward portioning of half an egg, etc. My wife is Head of
Orange Root Vegetable Procurement in our house, so I did follow Keller's
advice in the headnote, and use carrots with their tops still on them.

The batter is oil-based, and doesn't require any softening or
creaming of butter. Instead of busting out a stand mixer with a whisk
attachment, I just used a whisk attached to my arm.
