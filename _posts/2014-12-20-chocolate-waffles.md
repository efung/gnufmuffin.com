If there's one thing my son will always eat, it's anything made with
chocolate. This past Saturday for breakfast, we made a crowd-pleasing
batch of chocolate waffles.

This
[recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/chocolate-waffle-recipe.html)
from Alton Brown is very easy to make. There's no separate whipping of
the egg whites, no overnight rest, and no chocolate to melt. The batter
is quite thin, but doesn't spread or overflow in the waffle iron.

These are soft, not crispy waffles. Each bite has a chocolate chip
or two in it, and is very satisfying. I'd definitely make these again.
In fact, my son has already asked me to!
