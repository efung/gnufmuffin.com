As parents of a junior kindergarten student, we're now part of the
school community. An email announcing a bake sale arrived in
our inboxes a few weeks ago, and Dr. S and I had a spirited
discussion about what I should make. In the end, a chocolate-based
cookie won out.

The
[recipe](https://justbakedbyme.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/chewy-chocolate-chunk-cookies/)
is from the January 2009 issue of Cook's Illustrated. It achieves
chewiness through three techniques: using egg whites only (cut down on
excess fat), using cocoa powder (again, cutting down on excess fat from
chocolate), and using corn syrup (in place of some granulated sugar).
I made two substitutions that didn't affect flavour or texture, in my
opinion: clear corn syrup instead of dark, and light brown sugar
instead of dark.

If I really wanted to ensure identically sized cookies, I would
have weighed the bowl of dough, and then portioned out exactly
1/16th of the dough for each cookie. But I just eyeballed it, so
some cookies came out smaller than others, and some were thicker
than others. Not all of my baked cookies had cracked surfaces, but they
were definitely done at the specified time, 10 to 11 minutes.

These turned out amazing: true to their name, they were chewy and
chocolatey, even 2 days later (kept in an airtight container, of
course). I bet you they would be even tastier (at least, more caramel
flavoured), had I used the specified ingredients.
