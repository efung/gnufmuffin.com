It's a labour intensive recipe, requiring two doughs and lots of chilling time. Earlier in the week, I made a full batch of sweet tart dough, ensuring that the ground almonds were very finely ground and sieved. I split the dough into two halves, using one half for a <a href="/2005/09/shf-12-nectarine-custard-tart.html">nectarine custard tart</a>, and the other half for this cookie. Next, I made the chocolate dough. Rolling out these doughs is quite easy as the dough is full of butter, but you have to watch the ambient temperature as it melts easily and can get too thin. After making the dough &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo;, I put it in the freezer. On Saturday afternoon, before the guests to our post-wedding wine-cheese-dessert party arrived, I thawed out the dough and sliced it into logs. I didn't even need a hot knife: this dough sliced beautifully without any stickiness. The yield from this recipe is quite large, as each cookie is only a &frac14;" thick. Next time, I'll be sure to sift out the hazelnut pieces, as I found the smaller fragments to be a coughing hazard!
