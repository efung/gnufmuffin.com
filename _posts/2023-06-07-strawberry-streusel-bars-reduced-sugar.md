From the "2 for $5" deals at many of the supermarkets I've been visiting,
there seems to be a bumper crop of strawberries this year. This despite
the rains in California or hurricanes in Florida. Local Ontario strawberries
are more expensive, but they definitely look and taste better. Anyway,
these streusel bars, made for the office, don't actually call for fresh
berries, frozen are just fine.

The [recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/12712-strawberry-chamomile-streusel-bars-reduced-sugar)
is from the America's Test Kitchen book, _Naturally Sweet_. I turned it
back into a "normally" sweet recipe by replacing all the sugar substitutes
with actual sugar. The intriguing thing about this recipe was the use of
chamomile tea bags, which the headnote says underscores the berry flavor.
Unfortunately, I didn't have any.

There's not quite enough of the quick berry jam filling for my taste.
I did like that it's not overly sweet. But if you're going to be
having strawberry bars, you want a lot of strawberry flavour, no?
