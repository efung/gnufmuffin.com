I luurv citrus flavours, and probably my favourite muffin of all time is
this [orange one](/2005/10/orange-date-muffins.html), which uses an
entire raw orange, ground up in a food processor. I've also made Passover cakes
that employed whole citrus that have been boiled first to get rid of some
of the pith's bitterness. This cake, from a Bill Yosses' book, follows
the latter technique, and was okay, but not great.

The
[recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/06/bill-yosses-orange-glazed-olive-oil-cake-with.html)
is from his book, [The Perfect Finish](/tag/the-perfect-finish/). Since an 
orange is pretty big, compare to, say, a clementine, the directions call
for quartering the fruit before boiling. This makes the flesh very soft,
so by the end of the simmering, they're almost completely falling apart.

I liked that this recipe could be made completely in the food processor.
Unfortunately, the results were a bit lacklustre. I found the
cake a bit too dense, and a bit dull and one-dimensional. The best part was
the fresh orange glaze poured over top, that pools at the base of each slice,
and gets absorbed as it sits for a few days.
