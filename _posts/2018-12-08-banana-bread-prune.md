I've never eaten at [Prune](https://prunerestaurant.com/) before, but my wife
had brunch there last year, and brought me back a copy of the restaurant's
cookbook. It's unusual in a few ways: it's designed to look like a 
collection of hand-written sheets you might find in a kitchen, complete
with splatters, Post-It reminders, corrections, highlights, etc. The
recipe yields are written as if you were working in a successful, popular 
establishment, needing to serve hundreds for a brunch service. But the most 
glaring, and inexcusable omission is the lack of an index!

The aesthetic of the book is quite novel, and I do enjoy reading
the chef/owner's notes, chastising the kitchen staff. More than one critic
has commented on whether they reveal something about her
private personality. The missing index, however, is truly annoying. 
Fortunately, [Eat Your Books](https://www.eatyourbooks.com/) was in a position
to [help](https://www.eatyourbooks.com/blog/2016/4/8/an-unusual-cookbook-gets-an-index), 
and worked with the restaurant to produce a printable index. It's [available](https://prunerestaurant.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Prune-Index-Final-2.pdf) from Prune's website.

But on to the banana bread (p. 364): the headnote of the [recipe](https://www.thehungrytravelerblog.com/buttermilk-banana-bread/) mentions that the restaurant
makes several large loaves every weekend, to hand out to hungry patrons
lining up for their brunch. As a baker who has made his fair share of
banana bread, I've reached the point where I'm pretty satisfied with
the repertoire I've accumulated. However, this one was, 1) baked in a
long, 13" Pullman pan, which I've recently acquired, and 2) used a lot of
ground cloves.

After making this twice in the past few weeks, I would say it could be
one of my new favourites. The use of cinnamon and cloves adds a subtle warmth,
and the extended baking time (90 minutes) gives the cake a deep colour. The
really straight-sided, almost square slices is also very pleasing to me.
