The passing of strawberry season marks the beginning of cherry
season. At the farmer's market this weekend, we picked up two baskets
of sour cherries intending to turn them into jam.  But the extremely
hot weather deterred us from that canning project, and a last minute
call for a dessert prompted this delicious pie. It was a
resounding success, as five adults and three children devoured the
entire thing in one sitting.

I adapted a
[recipe](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/07/sour-cherry-pie-with-almond-crumble/)
I found on Smitten Kitchen. I already had a single pie crust dough
in the freezer, which I put in the fridge to thaw. To prepare the
filling, I first squeezed the pits out of the tiny, bright red
cherries. I did this over a strainer, to catch any juices.
Then, I mixed the cornstarch into the sugar, before stirring it
into the fruit. I added the seeds and pod of a vanilla bean at
this point too.

While the cherries macerated, I rolled out the bottom crust into a
false bottom 8" tart pan, and put it in the freezer for 10 minutes.
To make the crumble topping, I followed the recipe, but used 
about ½ cup ground almonds, instead of grinding whole nuts. This
made for a very fine crumb, which I lightly pressed into larger
clumps. Toppings like these are pretty forgiving, so you can adjust
the amount of oats, nuts and butter to your liking.

Since a lot of juice was exuded, I used a slotted spoon to drain
the cherries before putting them in the frozen crust, but put back
some of the liquid, so the filling wouldn't be too dry. Note that
this recipe suggests blind-baking the crust first, but I didn't, 
and my bottom wasn't soggy. [YMMV](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/YMMV), of course.

The finished pie was a deep golden brown all over, and individual
slices held up nicely on the plate. The amount of sugar called for
(¾ cup) was just enough to balance the acidity of the fruit, but
still left it plenty tart, as a sour cherry pie should be. I was 
hoping the vanilla would contribute a hint of sweetness, but it
was too pungent. I would make this again without hesitation, maybe 
playing with the coarseness of the crumble.
