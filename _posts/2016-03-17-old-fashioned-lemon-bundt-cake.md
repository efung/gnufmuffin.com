Sometimes life hands you lemons, and sometimes you just forget you
already had some, and you buy some more. That was the motivation behind
this week's lemon cake. 

The [recipe](http://www.eastbaytimes.com/ci_4403152) is from Regan
Daley's baking cookbook, one that I love making things out of, because
her flavour combinations and ideas are so appealing to me. However, this 
particular cake is not unusual or innovative, since lemon-scented cakes 
show up everywhere. But I do have notes about this particular version.

First, make sure you thoroughly grease (and flour) the Bundt pan. I
made a lazy attempt to wipe a bit of butter on the mold, and my cake 
came out in pieces. Second, read over the recipe before you start, so
you don't forget anything, like the eggs. I had to briskly stir
the eggs into the finished batter, and was pleasantly surprised to 
discover that the cake was actually edible, with a coarse, somewhat moist 
crumb, but still tender.

After recovering from these rookie mistakes, I made the cake again the
next night. This time, it turned out (literally) beautifully. While the
cake was hot, I applied spoonfuls of the buttery glaze on the highest
part of the cake, where it quickly melted and dribbled down the ridges.

Using butter in the icing is a bit over the top: it's extra work, and
I didn't feel the richness was necessary. Bundt cake is a nice treat,
but I prefer a lemon pound cake, moistened with a wet, citrusy syrup.
