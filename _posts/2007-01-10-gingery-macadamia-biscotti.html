excerpt: "I ground the very oily nuts with the sugar to prevent them from turning into a wet paste. Even though I used salted macadamias, they didn\'t affect the cookies\' taste. Instead of all honey, I used some syrup I had leftover from a jar of preserved stem ginger. These cookies are awesome, full of spice"

These cookies are awesome, full of spice and gentle heat.
