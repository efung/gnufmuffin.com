I added about a teaspoon of strawberry essence into the batter plus a bit of <a href="http://www.guavaberry.com/">Guavaberry</a> liqueur, as I didn't have any Wildberry schnapps. The cakes baked up quite firm and thin, as expected. For the icing, I used half a jar of Crofter's <a href="http://www.croftersorganic.com/products/product_displaystrawpsprCDN.html">organic strawberry spread</a>. To make the chocolate collar, I spread tempered white chocolate on a roll of acetate, let it firm up a little, then dragged a cake comb across the strip. I was only able to scrape a thin line away due to the triangular shape of the teeth. When it had hardened, I covered the white chocolate stripes with tempered milk chocolate. While it was still soft, I wrapped it around the cake, then put it in the freezer. The cake layers themselves were too firm, but I attribute that to overbaking and using the wrong pan size, but the strawberry icing is very tasty. Everyone at the birthday BBQ seemed to enjoy it!
