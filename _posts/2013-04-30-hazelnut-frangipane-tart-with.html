I was absolutely floored by the selection of produce: three kinds of blood oranges! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etrog">Etrog</a> in April! Several varieties of sweet potatoes and yams (actual distinction between the two!). Instead of souvenir trinkets, we brought back dried white nectarines from the Bowl, as I had never seen this before.<br /><br />The tart consists of three components. I didn't have to make the <i>pâte sucrée</i> crust, as I already had a disc of Hermé's Sweet Tart Dough in the freezer, which I thawed, pressed into a 10" tart pan and blind baked. The frangipane was also a snap: toast hazelnuts to remove their skins, then blitz everything in the food processor. For the fruit component, I used the last bag of <a href="http://thewimpyvegetarian.com/2012/03/spicy-blue-cheese-and-apricot-sables-baketogether/">Enduring Sun apricots</a> (the Natasha variety this time) plus some of the dried, white nectarines. These were reconstituted in boiling water, and left to soak in a covered bowl. The white nectarines REALLY plumped up: they were about an inch thick!<br /><br />The next evening, it was time to assemble. After spreading the frangipane in the cooked base, I blotted the dried fruit and arranged it over the tart in a circular pattern. After the minimum time in the oven, the filling was cooked, but the fruit hadn't really browned. A mini blowtorch made quick work of caramelizing some of the edges. At this point, the recipe calls for making a syrup from the soaking liquid by adding sugar to it and reducing. I decided there was already enough sweetness in the recipe, and just reduced it, and brushed a few tablespoons over top.<br /><br />This is absolutely delicious. I love frangipane, whether it's made with pistachios or almond or hazelnuts. And the flavour and texture contrast with the stone fruit works quite well.
