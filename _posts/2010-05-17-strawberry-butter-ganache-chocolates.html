The filling included strawberry jam, white chocolate and butter. At the last second, I forgot to put in the balsamic vinegar called for in the original recipe, so these turned into plain strawberry chocolates. Using half the recipe, I filled a 9&times;8" frame placed over a Silpat. It didn't set in 20 minutes, but took several hours instead. Cutting it into squares was not a problem, but the pieces were a little thin. Next time, I would use a slightly smaller frame.<br /><br />Tempering the dark chocolate seemed to go problem-free, but the dipped chocolates revealed some problems. I'm still getting streaks and crystallization, so I need to re-learn everything about tempering and control more of the variables. For a decoration, I cut triangles of a transfer sheet to apply to the tops, and also sprinkled on some pulverized, dehydrated strawberries. This was an exciting find from <a href="http://www.tnt-supermarket.com/en/">T&amp;T</a>.<br /><br />While they were visually appealing, the chocolates weren't all that tasty for me. The ratio of coating to filling was too low and I think they could be improved by making a thicker centre.
