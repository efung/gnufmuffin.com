excerpt: "For the sponge, I used kamut flour as well as some stoneground whole wheat flour, and let it ferment overnight as recommended for the &ldquo;ultimate full flavour&rdquo;. Beranbaum addresses the issue of kneading dough on #4 speed with the Kitchenaid mixer (whose manual says to only use #2 for bread)"

Beranbaum addresses the issue of kneading dough on #4 speed with the Kitchenaid mixer (whose manual says to only use #2 for bread) <a href="http://www.realbakingwithrose.com/2005/11/appropriate_mixer_speeds_for_b.html">here</a>. While the machine wheezed and rocked, it was able to get through 7 minutes without overheating. When I was in Japan last summer, I bought a banneton that I haven't used until today. During the final proof, I transferred the dough into the basket which I dusted heavily with brown rice flour. When the finished bread came out of the oven, it made loud crackling noises for a few minutes! The crust is very crisp, very soft interior with a good flavour. Bread really should be eaten while it's fresh.<br /><br />Sifu Renka took a picture of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sifu_renka/880689348/">slice</a> at the potluck.<br /><br />Here is Marie's <a href="http://breadbasketcase.blogspot.com/2007/04/hearth-bread.html">loaf</a> (she's the one that baked every recipe from this book!).
