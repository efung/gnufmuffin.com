excerpt: "My substitutions: 19 ounces of bittersweet chocolate replacing 16 oz semi + 3 oz unsweetened; all pecans instead of half walnuts. The &ldquo;dough&rdquo; is indeed quite batter-like. I bought a cookie scoop (&#35;24) to make these and it already feels like one of those indispensible gadgets. Incidentally,"

The &ldquo;dough&rdquo; is indeed quite batter-like. I bought a cookie scoop (&#35;24) to make these and it already feels like one of those indispensible gadgets. Incidentally, the number of the scoop is often engraved on the sweeper part inside the bowl, and refers to the number of level scoops per quart of food (e.g. ice cream). The suggested baking time was right on for a soft chewy texture. <span style="font-weight:bold;">WARNING</span>: These cookies are <span style="font-style:italic;">intense</span>. I struggled to eat two and then was jittery for a few hours. The espresso and chocolate are overwhelming.
