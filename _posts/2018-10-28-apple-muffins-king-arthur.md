After our annual apple picking trip, I had a fridge downstairs full
of Golden Delicious and Cortland apples. We were in the mood for muffins,
and were pleased to discover that this recipe made a pretty decent
breakfast treat.

The
[recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/apple-muffins-recipe) is
from King Arthur Flour. With a 50-50 mix of whole wheat and
all-purpose flour, you can almost convince yourself that eating
miniature cakes first thing in the morning is a healthy habit. The 
ingredients and method are easy-peasy, and there's not much to say about this
recipe.

My son's criticism was that even with 2 cups of chopped Cortland
apple, there still wasn't enough to have some in every bite!
