excerpt: "As a finale to my pulled pork BBQ lunch, I decided on a light, fruit-based dessert. This berry pie needed only a little bit of work to put together. The graham crust used only 9 crackers but 5 tbsp of butter which made it very greasy; I added two extra. It baked up quite soft but hardened as it cooled."

This berry pie needed only a little bit of work to put together. The graham crust used only 9 crackers but 5 tbsp of butter which made it very greasy; I added two extra. It baked up quite soft but hardened as it cooled. If it starts to shrink, spread it out while it's warm. The filling is made from sieved, pureed fruit that is cooked with a bit of sugar and cornstarch to thicken it. I liked that this pie didn't need any baking, but is set in the refrigerator. Unfortunately, I only had about 3 hours of chilling time, so the centre was a little soft, making the pieces somewhat sloppy. That said, no one complained about all the delicious berries coupled with a graham crust. A good crowd pleaser as it's visually stunning.
