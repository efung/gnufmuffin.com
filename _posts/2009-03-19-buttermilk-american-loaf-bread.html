excerpt: "Lisa's post looked so good that I wanted to make this right away. I used buttermilk, as Kimball said this variation was far superior than using plain milk, but forgot to heat the water to boiling. This resulted in a longer first rise in the oven for me.

I used buttermilk, as Kimball said this variation was far superior than using plain milk, but forgot to heat the water to boiling. This resulted in a longer first rise in the oven for me. The recipe heading says "no-knead" but it's a misnomer because you do have to knead it in a machine, just not by hand. The second rise went well and the loaf baked up into a beautiful bread, with a nice crumb and tangy flavour. This is a pretty fast bread to make because of the accelerated rises in a warm oven and shows you can make decent bread without a lot of effort.
