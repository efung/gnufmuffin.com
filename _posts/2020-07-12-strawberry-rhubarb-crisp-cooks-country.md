Sometimes you just want something quick and easy, and this one-pan recipe 
is a fast way to make a classic summer dessert. This strawberry-rhubarb crisp 
is started in a skillet, then finished in the oven, and can be on the table 
in under an hour.

Most crisp recipes need fruit to be pre-cooked (either in the microwave, oven, or stovetop).
This [recipe](https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/12524-strawberry-rhubarb-crisp)
is no different, but the cooking is done in the final pan in which it is
baked. I used the 10" cast iron skillet part of the two-piece [Lodge combo cooker](https://www.lodgemfg.com/product/cast-iron-combo-cooker?sku=LCC3).
What's nice about the recipe is that it allows you to use frozen
or fresh fruit.  I used both fresh and frozen rhubarb, and sliced
fresh berries. You don't want to overcook the filling on the stove:
just until the berries break down, the rhubarb is starting to soften,
and the liquid thickens.

Another timesaver in this recipe, is that the topping uses melted
butter, rather than cold butter that needs to be cut in (say, in a
food processor). Using panko gives the topping a different level
of crispiness. It's pretty plain otherwise, as there's no oats nor
nuts.

You might notice my crisp is a little pale. I ran out of brown sugar
and tried to replace it in the filling using white sugar mixed with
a bit of molasses.  That worked okay, since the liquid dissolved
the molasses easily. But I didn't want to risk clumps of undissolved
sticky brown stuff in the topping, so I just went with all white sugar.

Fresh out of the oven, a portion of this topped with vanilla ice
cream was a satisfying end to a meal. Unfortunately, leftovers
didn't hold so well, because the topping became significantly
softer. This recipe is one to keep in your back pocket, as it
can come together so quickly.
