I totally missed the discussions about this cookie, as a recipe first appeared in the LA Times back in 2003. Anyway, I tried making it last night using the modified version in RecipeGullet which calls for whipping the egg-sugar mix using a genoise method, and also a different baking temperature. I used a small #40 cookie scoop to portion the 1" balls; the dough was quite firm after a night in the fridge. I used the suggested baking times and they were perfectly moist in the centre, tasting like a chocolate truffle or brownie in cookie form. This wouldn't be my favourite cookie ever, but it is sure tasty.
