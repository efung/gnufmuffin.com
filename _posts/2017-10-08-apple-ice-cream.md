For a Thanksgiving dinner we hosted on Sunday, my parents were bringing a coffee
cake, and I wanted an ice cream to go with it. Naturally, with a basement fridge
full of apples, I looked for a suitable recipe. I happened upon one which
called for making applesauce first, and then I remembered what else I had in the
fridge.

With so much leftover [apple butter](/2017/10/slow-cooker-apple-butter.html), I
thought that it would be a good substitute for freshly made applesauce. It also
had the benefit of having less water and a more concentrated flavour. The
recipe comes from Emily Luchetti's _A Passion for Ice Cream_, and is really
simple: infuse one cinnamon stick in two cups of heated heavy cream and one cup 
of milk, then stir in 1Â½ cups of apple butter and two tablespoons of Calvados
or apple brandy.

The ice cream had a nice pale brown colour, and tiny specks
of caramelized apple. I really liked the intense apple flavour combined with
the dairy. The mouth feel wasn't as rich and smooth as an ice cream made with
eggs, but was still satisfying.
