My working parameters for a cake for my Dad's birthday were "fruit
or nuts, but no chocolate".  Instead of a cake, I made a tart
featuring chestnut and pear. It was relatively simple (by the
standards of a Pierre Hermé recipe) but wasn't up to the standards
of what I expect from his desserts.

The [recipe](https://alpineberry.blogspot.ca/2008/12/yuletide-carol.html)
comes from [_Desserts by Pierre Hermé_](/tag/desserts-by-pierre-herme/).
After making and chilling the tart dough on Sunday morning, I
blind-baked it briefly (15 minutes) in the evening, and held it
overnight. I also made a small batch of homemade _crème fraîche_,
combining a half cup of heavy cream with a generous tablespoon of
buttermilk.

Surprisingly, the chestnut purée was difficult to find at a large
supermarket (Longo's). My neighbourhood supermarket had **two**
kinds, one sweetened and one unsweetened. On Monday morning, I
assembled the filling. The pears I purchased were ripe, but still
firm.  After sprinkling the diced fruit and crumbled chestnuts in
the shell, I poured over the liquid ingredients.

After a 40 minute bake in a moderate oven, the custard was set. I turned
the oven up, and made the phyllo topping. The top layer browns very quickly,
so check every 30 seconds after 5 minutes.

I have to say I was disappointed in how this turned out. The combination
should have been delicious, but the chestnut flavor was weak, and the custard
layer was quite thin. I also wanted all of the phyllo layers to be caramelized,
not just the top one.
