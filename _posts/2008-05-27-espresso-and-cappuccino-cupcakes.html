Both cupcakes are made in the food processor but the quantities are so small that it was hard to get everything well-mixed with a minimum of processing to avoid toughness. The espresso cupcakes are frosted with melted chocolate, butter and espresso powder and there was just the right amount. On the other hand, the icing for the cappuccino cupcakes was way too much for the dozen cupcakes; half of the recipe would have been enough. I used large muffin tins lined with medium-sized paper cups; the batter filled these perfectly. As a decorating idea, I wanted to make some cocoa powder stars on top of the white icing, but the detail was lost with the small stencil I made, so I just dusted the tops.
