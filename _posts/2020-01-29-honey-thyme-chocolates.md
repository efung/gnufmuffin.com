For our housewarming party, I wanted to make a variety of chocolates,
not only in flavour, but in appearance also. This honey-thyme
chocolate sounded interesting (herbs in sweets!) but its technique
of a texture via a wire baking rack wasn't one I had tried before.

The recipe is from _Making Artisan Chocolates_ by Andrew Garrison
Shotts. The yield is only 30 chocolates, so the quantities are quite
small. For example, in the ganache, there's just two-and-a-half
ounces of heavy cream and honey, to infuse 3 sprigs of fresh thyme.
Only 15 minutes are called for in the recipe, which is a woefully
short time for the herb to impart its flavour. By contrast, Michael
Recchuiti's famous Tarragon Ganache calls for a **half cup** of
dried tarragon leaves, infused in 7 ounces of cream **overnight**.

Anyway, I was most interested in the finishing technique. After
dipping each round ganache ball in tempered chocolate, you roll
each truffle over a wire baking rack. My wife helped with this part,
and soon figured out that you need to wait about 15 seconds or so
for the chocolate to start to thicken, before rolling.

To give the chocolates a bit of colour, I used a ["fat dispersible
food colorant" from Roxy & Rich](https://www.roxyandrich.com/food-coloring/fat-dispersible-food-colouring).
After a bit of experimentation, the nicest look was achieved by gently tapping
the powder through a small sieve over the chocolates.

These chocolates were just so-so. Some people thought they were
coconut-based macaroons! I could barely taste the thyme and
would definitely do a longer infusion next time.
