There's a first time for everything, and this past week, I baked my
first few loaves of sourdough, using a starter I built up from scratch.

In the [Bouchon Bakery](/tag/Bouchon%20Bakery/) book, the authors give a
formula for a _liquid levain_, a high hydration starter. To encourage
active development, the feeding schedule for the first four days is
twice daily. I wasn't very rigorous about the time or materials, and 
varied my usage of tap vs filtered water, and bread vs AP flour.

The book says you can start using it after six feedings. So on the
fourth day, I tried using the levain in the multigrain bread
[recipe](http://www.annies-eats.com/2013/10/10/multigrain-bread/).
Unfortunately, it turned out pretty poorly. The loaves didn't ferment
long enough, and were quite dense and not very sour. I didn't have
rye flour, and subbed in brown rice flour. Unfortunately, these loaves
were duds and we ended up throwing them in the compost bin.

I continued feeding the starter but reduced the frequency to once
daily, intending to make it less active and more sour. The
second time I tried making the bread, the starter was about 8 days old.
This time, the loaves turned out much lighter, with a stronger
sour flavour. I took these to share with the office.

This week, I tried it once more, with a levain that was a full two weeks
old. Above is the finished dough, this time, made with all the specified
ingredients, but I did change up the soaker, swapping out half the sesame 
with cornmeal. The kneading time is a full twenty minutes (I used
Speed&nbsp;2 on a KitchenAid stand mixer), and the dough is
well-developed and strong at this point.

My new equipment, a linen _couche_ and bread _lame_ arrived from
[Breadtopia](http://breadtopia.com/), just in time for these loaves. I
shaped the batards and set them on the flour-dusted linen. After
proofing, I slashed them with a single, long cut. The razor is very,
very sharp and mounting it to a handle is certainly easier to use
than holding a snap blade directly (which is what I was using
before).

The top of the baked bread opened up nicely, and developed a 
[grigne](http://www.thekitchn.com/word-of-mouth-la-grigne-109750) but
didn't get much colour. For steam generation, I used a preheated
cast iron pan that I dumped boiling water into. I need to find
my spray bottle to spritz the surface of the loaves as well as the oven
walls.

We were very pleased with this bread. It tasted wholesome, with a
complex flavour. The next time I make this, I'll try a few improvements,
by using a more sour starter, and work on improving the
the browning of the crust.
