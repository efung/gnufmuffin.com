excerpt: "This cake seemed like a good way to use up a lot of ingredients at once (I\'m moving to a house soon). There were lots of tips in this eGullet post which were helpful the second time I made this loaf. Don\'t bother with breaking up the almond paste with the mixer, it\'s very faster to use a food processor."

Don't bother with breaking up the almond paste with the mixer, it's very faster to use a food processor. I used marzipan, so I reduced the total amount of white sugar by a third. Lining the loaf pan with parchment is a must as well. My first cake stuck to the bottom of the pan when I only greased the pan. After the eggs were added, I didn't need to mix it for the entire 10 minutes. Stirring in the fruit before the flour was completely incorporated helped to prevent the pieces from falling to the bottom of the pan. It filled a 9&times;5" pan almost completely and needed almost 85 minutes to be fully baked. What a delicious cake! Moist, tender and aromatic. Chunks of fruit and ginger with pieces of chocolate throughout. A real winner.
