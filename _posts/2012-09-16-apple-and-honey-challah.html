excerpt: "By popular request, I made two challahs with honey and apples, following a recipe I hadn\'t tried before. The braiding into a round shape was new to me, as I\'ve previously just made round challahs in a cake tin. These loaves didn\'t turn out that well for me: I let them bake too long without covering,"

The braiding into a round shape was new to me, as I've previously just made <a href="/2010/09/apple-honey-challah.html">round challahs</a> in a cake tin. These loaves didn't turn out that well for me: I let them bake too long without covering, so they almost burned. And folding the apples into the dough before dividing into strands just results in apples falling out everywhere. The only successful method for making apple or pear challah, in my opinion, is flattening each strand, wrapping it around the apples, then pinching the seams closed, e.g. in <a href="/2012/01/fine-cookings-challah.html">this loaf</a>.
