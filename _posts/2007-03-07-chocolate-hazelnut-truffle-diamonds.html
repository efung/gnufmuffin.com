This fit nicely in two 8&times;8" non-stick pans (128 in<sup>2</sup>) plus one 6&times;6" pan (36 in<sup>2</sup>) with removable bottom. I toasted the ground hazelnuts which helped with the nutty flavour of the base; it was very crunchy though, and was hard to cut cleanly. I creamed the butter and sugar using my new KitchenAid 5-Speed Classic Hand Mixer; is it supposed to be so quiet? The truffle topping is quite soft at room temperature but firmer straight from the fridge. A delicious treat to go with a hot drink, but the textures of the two layers don't quite match.
