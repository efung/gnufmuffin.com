excerpt: "We\'re trying to incorporate more pumpkin into our diets, so I decided to try this interesting cake with fresh puree. The entire issue has distinctly modern tone to it, from the prominent use of whitespace to the bold, primary-coloured graphics. In this recipe, what is unusual is the level of detail"

The entire issue has distinctly modern tone to it, from the prominent use of whitespace to the bold, primary-coloured graphics. In this recipe, what is unusual is the level of detail in the arrangement of the pineapple. You are supposed to use three different sizes of round cookie cutter, plus cut a ring out of the pineapple too! I didn't use pineapple juice concentrate in the topping, just regular pineapple juice. The cake turned out alright, with the dominant flavours being molasses and pineapple. Everyone enjoyed the topping the most!
