I don't see pie offered as a dessert in many restaurants anymore. Maybe
it's because I don't frequent [diner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner)-type
establishments, or it's no longer trendy. Even the Canadian Pie Company location
in Leslieville closed a few years ago after a short run. Being able to make
what you want to eat is perhaps the most important reason for learning
how to cook or bake. With these thoughts in mind, I made this pie
twice in the past week, as we're in the height of blueberry season.

The [recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/07/best-blueberry-pie-dessert-recipe.html) 
is by [Stella Parks](http://www.seriouseats.com/editors/stella-parks) who describes
in great detail how to make the optional herringbone crust. This elaborate lattice
is what attracted me in the first place, and also the reason why I needed to repeat
this dessert.

The provided dough recipe is the old-fashioned kind, without the aid of an electric
appliance. You take butter cubes and smash them flat. I tried both a large metal spoon
and the bottom of a metal measuring cup, and the latter yielded great results.
Her instructions say to use the palm of your hand, but I felt that would warm up
the butter too much. Do use a scale to carefully divide the dough for the lattice 
and the bottom: there isn't any extra at all in this recipe.

Weaving the herringbone pattern takes some practise. Making enough strips is key
as the pattern doesn't look nice otherwise. The first time around, 
my lattice didn't turn out anything like the photos, and I didn't figure
out where I went wrong. The second time was much better. I'd watch her timelapse 
video, and read the instructions a few times before trying it, maybe even
practise with strips of fabric!

A trick I employed for the second pie, was to make the lattice separately, freeze it,
then slide it onto the filling. Learn from my mistake, and don't do this on a
curved plate, unless it's floured well; a cardboard round lined with parchment
would be much easier.

As for the filling, Stella suggests a mix of cultivated and wild blueberries, 
as the latter have superior flavour, but are usually three times the cost. 
I found that the taste of the pie was dominated by the tapioca starch, which always
has a metallic taste to me. However, there was no mistaking what kind of pie
this was. I loved the look of this top crust, and will definitely try it
again in the fall.
