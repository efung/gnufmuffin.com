This recipe seemed rich: 4 eggs and a half cup of oil, but I stuck to the proportions as it was my first time. I made a few small changes, swapping out a bit of AP flour for kamut, and using hazelnut oil alongside sunflower for the vegetable oil. Even after resting 20 minutes, and as mentioned in some of the website's comments, the batter was quite runny and spread easily. My first batch of waffles oozed all over the iron, but I always put mine over a baking sheet to catch drips. As I made subsequent batches, I made sure to use less better, and also let the waffles cook a minute and start to set before closing the lid.<br /><br />With ground hazelnuts laced throughout the batter, their flavour permeates the whole waffle. An excellent breakfast treat, and one I would make again.
