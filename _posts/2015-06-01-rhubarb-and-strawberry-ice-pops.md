My family often samples the ice pops offered by
[Augie's](http://www.augiesicepops.com/) at the various farmer's
markets in the city. But at $3 for a regular, and $1.50 for a mini, it's
a pricey treat that can be easily made at home. With rhubarb season
in full swing, and strawberry season just around the corner, I made
a batch of ice pops from this classic combination.

We recently made some unusual flavours (pineapple-mango-chipotle,
strawberry-cucumber-mint) so it was nice to go back to a familiar
pairing. The recipe, from the People's Pops cookbook, could not be
easier: cook the rhubarb in a bit of water until it falls apart, then
puree it with strawberries, and sweeten to taste with simple syrup.

Not surprisingly, these pops were great: tart and sweet, with a nice
strawberry fragrance. I would use less simple syrup next time (or more
lemon juice), as I would expect anything made with rhubarb to offer more
acidity.
