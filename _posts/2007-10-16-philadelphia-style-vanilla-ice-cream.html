excerpt: "I used the cream-milk combination and a Tahitian vanilla bean that I bought from here. What an easy recipe, no need to make a custard and deal with leftover whites. I left the bean in to infuse for a day and it really produced a great vanilla fragrance. While the ice cream doesn't have that rich mouthfeel,"

What an easy recipe, no need to make a custard and deal with leftover whites. I left the bean in to infuse for a day and it really produced a great vanilla fragrance. While the ice cream doesn't have that rich mouthfeel, it's still delicious and much easier to make. Two thumbs up.
