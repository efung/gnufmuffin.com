Unfortunately, this didn't turn out very well. Step One is to toast pecans and then toss them in a bit of butter. I haven't read why she calls for this buttering step, as it's one of the few times I've ever seen it called for in a recipe. The batter more than filled my 8&times;4" tin (smaller than the one called for) so I made a few extra cupcakes too. In the oven, the loaf didn't rise very much. The interior was also very moist and dense and a little too sweet, not what I like in a banana bread at all. I wouldn't make this again.
