I love the pairing in a <a href="/2006/08/lemon-blueberry-tart.html">tart</a>, <a href="/2006/04/lemon-blueberry-muffins.html">muffin</a>, <a href="/2007/10/lemon-blueberry-sour-cream-coffee-cake.html">coffee cake</a> or <a href="/2008/04/lemon-poppy-seed-waffles-with-blueberry.html">waffles</a>.<br /><br />This loaf is a no-brainer to make and is an excellent breakfast or snack treat. The lemon syrup drizzled on top really made it for me, but I skipped the icing on the cake. Leftover slices froze nicely and were delicious warmed in the micro.
