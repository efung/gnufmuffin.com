Local peaches are stacked a metre high in most supermarkets so I wanted to make something with the 6L that I bought (besides eating them). This recipe calls for poaching the peaches briefly in a vanilla syrup. My only changes were to use a blend of pastry and AP flour instead of cake flour, and baking in a 9" cake pan rather than a 10" one. After 40 minutes, the cake was lightly browned on top, rising just above the lip of the 2" sides. There was far too much butter-brown sugar glaze; I would reduce it by a third next time.  The cake is a little on the dry side, but the gooey glaze and soft fruit help balance that. This isn't a bad dessert overall, but it doesn't stand out either.
