excerpt: "I used my remaining blue plums to make this custard and fruit cake. The crust is a crumbly mixture of butter, flour, cinnamon, cloves, sugar and sour cream. The filling is just plums over which is poured a custard mixture. Some reserved crust crumble is sprinkled over top and the whole thing is baked"

The crust is a crumbly mixture of butter, flour, cinnamon, cloves, sugar and sour cream. The filling is just plums over which is poured a custard mixture. Some reserved crust crumble is sprinkled over top and the whole thing is baked for an hour. The weak part for me was the crust, which was nicely flavoured with warm spices but was too dry and crumbly. There wasn't much filling, but the sweet-tangy balance was nice.
