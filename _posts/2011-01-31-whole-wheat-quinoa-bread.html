At first, I thought two loaves might be too much for my stand mixer, but I forged ahead anyway. This recipe uses a sponge plus cooked quinoa so it\'s not as simple as, say, no-knead bread. I used"

At first, I thought two loaves might be too much for my stand mixer, but I forged ahead anyway. This recipe uses a sponge plus cooked quinoa so it's not as simple as, say, no-knead bread. I used almost the full amount of whole wheat flour as the dough was very, very sticky and clung to the dough hook. I can't remember, but I think I did the first rise in the fridge. For shaping the two loaves, I divided the giant dough ball into two, flattened each one into a rectangle, then made a <a href="http://www.folds.net/tutorial/folds/cupboard/cupboard_fold.html">cupboard fold</a>, pressing the edges firmly into the centre. Then, I rolled it up starting from a short end. <br /><br />The shaped loaf rose quite high, and even higher in the oven. It turned out beautifully, with a plump shape and moist interior. The double egg glaze gave it a shiny shell and held all the sesame seeds in place. There's a slight chew from the cooked grains that I enjoy.
