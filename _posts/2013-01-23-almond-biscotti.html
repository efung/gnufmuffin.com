If I were to summarize the key takeaways from this recipe, they would be:<br /><ol><li>Whip eggs to aerate dough and keep it light</li><li>Add ground nuts for flavour and to prevent cookie from being too hard</li><li>Increase quantity of flavourings to compensate for the extended baking time</li></ol>I made a version with almonds and one with pistachios, without any additional spices. Both were delicious and kept quite well for a few weeks.
