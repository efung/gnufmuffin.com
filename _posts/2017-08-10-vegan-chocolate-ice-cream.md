Continuing with my exploration into vegan ice creams, I made the chocolate
recipe from the Van Leeuwen cookbook. Some of the other recipes they've
formulated require a few ingredients I didn't have on hand, e.g. unrefined
peanut oil, a good peppermint extract. But I always have a good supply
of chocolate in my pantry.

One point the authors stress is that you shouldn't tinker at all with
the recipes, as the precise proportions and adherence to the directions
are vital in achieving a well-textured vegan ice cream. Fortunately,
I'm a recipe follower so I'm pleased to report that this batch turned
out perfectly. The chocolate flavour was intense, and the texture was 
rich and fudgy. My son even thought he liked this better than regular
ice cream!
