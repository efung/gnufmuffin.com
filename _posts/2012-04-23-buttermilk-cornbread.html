excerpt: "For my birthday, one of the gifts Dr. S got us was a cast-iron pan. I\'ve never had one before, but I\'ve always heard great things about these indestructible, heat-retaining hulks of cookware. I knew the first thing I wanted to try was a cornbread. It turned out pretty well using the coarse cornmeal"

I've never had one before, but I've always heard great things about these indestructible, heat-retaining hulks of cookware. I knew the first thing I wanted to try was a cornbread. It turned out pretty well using the coarse cornmeal I got from <a href="http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/vendors/vendor_detail/93">Rube's Rice</a>.<br /><br /><b>Update</b> (2012-06-19): After making several more cornbreads (with ground sunflower seeds, with an overnight cornmeal soak), I still haven't perfected my technique yet. The top crust is still too pale and the outside doesn't always get nicely browned. I think I need to preheat the pan longer, and bake longer too.
