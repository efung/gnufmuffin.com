excerpt: "For Rosh Hashanah this year, I again made the apple-honey challahs I made last year, but at the last minute, also made a dessert from the very ripe plums and peaches my mother-in-law had on the counter. Unfortunately, this recipe was a big let down. There is very little batter to fill a 9 by 13\" pan."

Unfortunately, this recipe was a big let down. There is very little batter to fill a 9 by 13" pan. It came out quite crisp and dry, almost like toast. I used Splenda to sweeten it (making it diabetic friendly) and turbinado sugar on top for the crunch. I would not make this again.
