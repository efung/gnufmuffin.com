Looking for an oatmeal porridge recipe, a search for <code>oatmeal
candied orange</code> led me instead to these scones. These took less
than an hour from start to finish, and was an easy breakfast treat for a
Sunday morning.

<i>Food &amp; Wine</i> is the source for this
[recipe](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/candied-orange-oat-scones).
It's made in one bowl, and doesn't require rolling, just a quick shaping
into a round, and then cut into wedges. If you skipped toasting the
oatmeal, and used precut dried fruit, they'd be even quicker to
assemble.

These scones were pretty good, tender and light. They're not dry at all,
but that's to be expected with the generous amount of butter and
buttermilk. I don't know that I'd make these again, though.
