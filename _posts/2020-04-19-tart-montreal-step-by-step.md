My parents gifted me a cookbook a few years ago, and it beautifully captures
the essence of a bakery in Edmonton, where my aunt lives. I finally made one 
of the more elaborate, multi-step, multi-flavour desserts from the book,
and it was _so_ worth it.

The recipe is from _Duchess Bake Shop_, the cookbook of a [celebrated bakery](https://duchessbakeshop.com/)
in Edmonton, AB. The author has French-Canadian roots, and Montréal is
a large city in the province of Québec, a major producer of maple
syrup in the country. 

# Spiced Whipped Ganache

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821235381/in/dateposted/" title="Spiced White Chocolate Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821235381_39452f41e4_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Spiced White Chocolate Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821235156/in/photostream/" title="Spiced White Chocolate Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821235156_e8ca219b4a_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Spiced White Chocolate Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I started with this component first, because it needs an overnight chill. The spicing is pretty mild, just a pinch of ginger and cinnamon. There is 
much more cream than white chocolate, so the ganache will not set firmly.

# Chocolate Pate Sucree

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820698773/in/photostream/" title="Chocolate Pate Sucree"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820698773_f6c5ace982_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Chocolate Pate Sucree"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've made tart dough countless times, but I'm still not great at it. This dough
is quite buttery, and you can't skimp on any refrigeration time. I had a lot of
cracking after I transferred the dough to my tart ring, but it's so soft that
there's no trouble patching it. Make sure to dock it well, to avoid having to 
pop any giant air pockets mid-bake.

Notice I rolled the dough too thin and had leftover scraps. I baked these off anyways,
and the kids enjoyed the slightly burnt, chocolatey crisps.

# Spiced Nuts

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821243001/in/photostream/" title="Spiced Nuts"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821243001_73ff35d65f_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Spiced Nuts"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

While the tart shell was chilling, I worked on the garnishes. These nuts
are caramelized in two steps. First, the sugar syrup is cooked to the soft-ball
stage (about 240℉) and the warmed nuts are stirred into it. As they cool, they
get an even coating of white sugar.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821242826/in/photostream/" title="Spiced Nuts"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821242826_83d7b11343_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Spiced Nuts"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then, in a clean saucepan, you slowly melt the coating on the sugared nuts. This took some
time, and melted faster when I turned up the temperature.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820699883/in/photostream/" title="Spiced Nuts"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820699883_ebb19ffc33_w.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="Spiced Nuts"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Finally, the spices and cocoa butter are stirred in to coat them in the flavouring and keep the nuts separate.
The book mentions that regular butter is okay, but reduces the shelf life. This is a good tip to file away.

# Salted Chocolate Bark
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821244091/in/photostream/" title="Chocolate Bark"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821244091_de8b673c42_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Chocolate Bark"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820701323/in/photostream/" title="Chocolate Bark"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820701323_b5aba77963_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Chocolate Bark"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There's not much of a recipe here, just melting chocolate, spreading it thin, then sprinkling toppings
on. For a colour contrast, I used slivered pistachios and pink peppercorns, briefly pulsed in a spice grinder.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821243761/in/photostream/" title="Chocolate Bark"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821243761_f36eee5c1d_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Chocolate Bark"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was lazy and didn't bother tempering the chocolate. In addition to the pulverized ingredients, I
turned a few twists of pink Himalayan salt onto the chocolate too. Since it won't dissolve, the 
finished bark actually sparkled!

# Maple Bourbon Ganache

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820702143/in/photostream/" title="Maple Bourbon Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820702143_f9892a10fa_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Maple Bourbon Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821244671/in/photostream/" title="Maple Bourbon Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821244671_52b8234562_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Maple Bourbon Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Just four ingredients make up this component: milk chocolate, cream, maple syrup and bourbon. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821244581/in/photostream/" title="Maple Bourbon Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821244581_e32e7b1d74_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Maple Bourbon Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I made this after the baked crust had cooled, as it needs to be pourable.

# Feuilletine Base

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821555067/in/photostream/" title="Chocolate Feuilletine Base"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821555067_2f53019878_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Chocolate Feuilletine Base"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I absolutely love any excuse to use feuilletine. Stirring it into pure chocolate allows its crunch to be preserved.
Definitely don't mix it into ganache, where the moisture will immediately soften the wafers.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821554872/in/photostream/" title="Chocolate Feuilletine Base"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821554872_5352f201e6_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Chocolate Feuilletine Base"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Once the tart shell was blind-baked and cooled, I was able to spread the base into the bottom.

# Assembly

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821246626/in/dateposted/" title="Tart Montréal - Pouring Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821246626_3b5de58709_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Pouring Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820703958/in/photostream/" title="Tart Montréal - Ganache Base"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820703958_bd77e7d5eb_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Ganache Base"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There is just enough maple bourbon ganache to fill an 8" tart shell. It needs a couple of hours to set up in the fridge.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821556972/in/photostream/" title="Tart Montréal - Whipping Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821556972_fb99442257_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Whipping Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The white chocolate ganache stays fluid even after an eight-hour refrigeration, but whips up into nice soft peaks that can be piped.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820705263/in/photostream/" title="Tart Montréal - Whipped Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820705263_2a395fe076_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Whipped Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Once the base is made, you get to exercise some creativity! First, piping the white ganache into random sized
dots with a plain tip.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821556602/in/photostream/" title="Tart Montréal - Piped Ganache"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821556602_114511c5c5_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Piped Ganache"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The chocolate bark did not snap into shards cleanly, as my chocolate wasn't tempered. Since the pieces are so
thin, I didn't want to handle them with bare hands, lest they melt.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820706123/in/photostream/" title="Tart Montréal - Adding Chocolate Bark"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820706123_8744d8c88f_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Adding Chocolate Bark"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49821557532/in/photostream/" title="Tart Montréal - Assembly"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49821557532_6efc4fa458_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Assembly"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Lastly, a sprinkle of chopped, spiced nuts, and a few flakes of feuilletine:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/49820707868/in/photostream/" title="Tart Montréal - Adding Spiced Nuts"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820707868_1418892556_w.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tart Montréal - Adding Spiced Nuts"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Tada!

As for the taste? Every forkful had delicious contrasts: maple bourbon combined with warm spices, two
textures of ganache, crispy wafers and crunchy nuts, salt and pepper in the garnish… a masterpiece. 
One big criticism I had was that my tart shell was too hard, I must have worked and rolled it too much.
This made slicing and even eating a little awkward.

From [Duchess' website](https://www.facebook.com/duchessbakeshop/posts/10156351844221706?comment_id=10156352065961706), I saw that they have changed this tart up a bit, and now feature tiny piped
dots of a tart apricot gel on top!
