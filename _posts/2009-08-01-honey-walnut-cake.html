excerpt: "We\'ve been really busy with travel, vacation and wedding planning so there hasn\'t been much time to bake. While we were at a cottage, I made crowd-pleasers like blueberry scones and mixed berry pie. This holiday weekend, I had time to try something new and bake a little snack cake. I loved that this"

While we were at a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/sets/72157621809050845/">cottage</a>, I made crowd-pleasers like <a href="/2007/06/blueberry-scones.html">blueberry scones</a> and mixed berry pie. This holiday weekend, I had time to try something new and bake a little snack cake. I loved that this cake used ground walnuts in the batter. Instead of the honey-glazed nut garnish, I just embedded walnut halves in the cake before baking. As to be expected, this was a moist, slightly crumbly cake with a delicate orange scent (I used orange oil instead of zest). Very tasty and it kept well for three days at room temperature.
