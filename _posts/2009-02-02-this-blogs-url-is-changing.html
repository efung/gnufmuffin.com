This blog has been hosted on my ISP for some time, but I'm switching providers. I've moved the blog over to Blogspot, with the URL <a href=""></a>. Those of you who've bookmarked the redirection URL <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/">http://gnuf.blogsite.org/</a> should hopefully get redirected automatically. In the meantime, things may be broken for a while.
