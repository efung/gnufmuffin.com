On our drive back from Montreal last week, we stopped at an
[orchard](http://www.marlinorchards.com/) outside of Cornwall.
The only variety they had available for U-Pick was McIntosh, 
so that limited the baking applications somewhat. However, 
I found a recipe for strudel that called for this variety, and 
made it early one morning this week.

This Cook's Illustrated's
[recipe](http://www.boston.com/ae/food/cooks_illustrated/apple_studel/) for
strudel attempts to streamline and simplify the process of making
strudel from scratch. It called for Granny Smith and McIntosh apples.
The former holds up during baking, while the later softens and acts
like a glue around the other ingredients. Since I was skipping the
raisins, the first step of soaking them in Calvados was unnecessary.

I was generous with the apples, and didn't stick exactly to the prescribed 
quantity of 10 ounces each. This turned out to be problematic as the
rectangles of phyllo were too small to completely cover the filling. I
did the best I could and slid the barely enclosed strudel onto the baking
sheet. As it baked, the strudel leaked a bit of juice, but not
excessively.

Fresh out of the oven, the pastry layers were crisp on the exterior, and
soft on the underside. The filling seemed undercooked though: the Granny Smith
slices were still firm, and their tart flavour wasn't welcome. After a
few days in the fridge, the strudel turned limp and soft, and couldn't
be rescued in a toaster oven. Phyllo, while easier to acquire and
use, just isn't a convincing substitute for strudel dough. Maybe
I'll just stick to buying strudel from a good Eastern European bakery.
