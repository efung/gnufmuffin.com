We bought two baskets each of white and yellow peaches from [Bizjak
Farms](http://bizjakfarms.com/) this weekend at the farmers' market.
Supermarket fruit tend to be a little underripe, so they survive
transport better, but buying straight from the farmer yields deliciously
ripe fruit. There's going to be a lot of peach posts this week!

First up, is a white peach sorbet. The
[recipe](http://www.talkbeer.com/community/threads/persica-lif-i-could-eat-a-peach-for-hours.1440/page-2#post-45672)
comes from the Momofuku Milk Bar cookbook. To keep things simple, I
didn't make the entire dessert, which also includes a graham ganache and
milk crumbs. Because two of my giant peaches weighed 400 grams already,
I made a double batch.

Making the sorbet is straightforward, but it does call for non-standard
ingredients: glucose, citric acid, gelatin leaf. Fortunately, you can
make reasonable substitutions for all of these things. I had a few
moments of nervousness while stirring the glucose into the fruit pur√©e:
it didn't look like it was going to dissolve. After a few minutes of
constant stirring, the syrup combined nicely. Don't be put off by the
murky, dishwater-like colour of the sorbet base, as it turns a pleasant
pale pink when churned.

The fruit flavour of the sorbet is subtle but nicely balanced.
From my experience with Tosi's recipes, she really likes her salt, and
it's definitely noticeable in this sorbet. There's an interesting
interplay between salty, tart and sweet going on. 

Please enjoy this video that we filmed of making white peach sorbet:
