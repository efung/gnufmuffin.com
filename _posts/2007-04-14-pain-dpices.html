One of the key components of this cake/bread hybrid is honey: I used some chestnut honey from France that a <a href="http://wscwong.blogs.friendster.com/">friend</a> kindly bought for me a year ago; it was dark and pungent. Daley says instead of using filtered water, you could use milk, but I decided on almond milk. I didn't add the optional currants. After aging for 4 days in the fridge, the cake was ready to be baked, and I did so in the suggested large (9&times;5") and medium (8&times;4") pans. The loaves rose to a good height in the oven, giving off a scent not unlike Play-Doh (!!!); this was likely the star anise combined with the honey. I aged the baked loaves for over a week before cutting into them yesterday. They have a dense texture, reminiscent of rye bread; it's not chewy, but it doesn't crumble like cake either. My tasters surprisingly approved of the complex flavours. Every bite is slightly different: sometimes you taste the orange peel, sometimes the almonds, sometimes the blend of spices. I like this one better than one I made <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2005/12/fruit-and-spice-loaf-cake.html">previously</a>.
