excerpt: "I can\'t resist &ldquo;weird&rdquo; ingredients in food, so an old-fashioned wartime cake that used mayonnaise was begging to be made. Also, we had a leftover jar of mayo from making potato salad the weekend before, and we rarely use mayo. The cake  requires two bowls, no electric mixer, and is non-dairy"

Also, we had a leftover jar of mayo from making potato salad the weekend before, and we rarely use mayo. The cake  requires two bowls, no electric mixer, and is non-dairy to boot. It baked up evenly and was well received by my tasters. I, however, found that it tasted like Betty Crocker cake, so if that's what you're after, this is the cake for you.
