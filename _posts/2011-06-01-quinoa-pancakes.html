After cooking and cooling a batch of quinoa, the rest of this pancake recipe came together quickly. I used cake flour instead of all-purpose so the pancakes would be more tender, and adding blueberries makes them even better.<br /><br />These were definitely thick and hearty while being soft and tender. There's the distinct grassy/nutty taste from the quinoa which needs maple syrup or another topping to mask. I would make these again, especially if I had leftover plain, cooked quinoa.
