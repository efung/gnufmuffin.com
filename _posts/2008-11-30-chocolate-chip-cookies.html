To save you from reading the whole article, here are the highlights: let the dough rest for 1 to 3 days in the fridge for better flavor; make them big so you get a crisp edge and a soft centre; use chocolate discs (or wafers or <i>feves</i>) to get layers of chocolate; top with salt to heighten the flavor. Were all these modern techniques worth it? I made one batch with dough that had chilled for 8 hours, and another batch that had chilled for 2 days. Both produced very tasty cookies, but they came out quite crisp and hard. We may have made them too small or ran the oven too hot. I loved the big pieces of chocolate in the cookie and the rich butterscotch flavour.
