I wanted to make a quick dessert for our casual Shabbat dinner
last night. A simple apple and custard square recipe caught my eye
in [Baking Chez Moi](/tag/baking-chez-moi/), but, because I was
rushing after coming home from work, I started making the wrong
recipe, this apple _matafan_!

A [matafan](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matafan), from what the Interweb 
tells me, is a traditional, hearty savoury breakfast item from the Savoie
region of France. In Dorie's version, she uses apples instead of potatoes,
making it a sweet start to the day, similar to a German apple pancake or Dutch
baby.

Since no one wanted a pancake for dessert, I put away all the pre-mixed
components (melted butter and milk, flour mixture, whipped eggs and
sugar) in the fridge for later. When I woke up this morning, I 
made the batter, then mixed in thinly sliced Macintosh apples.

The directions call for frying it gently on the lowest possible
heat, but on my gas range's simmer setting, that was too low. After
15 minutes, the bottom had barely begun to brown, and was still
runny on top. Next time, I'll know to use a slightly hotter setting
on that small burner, or perhaps the lowest setting on one of the
larger burners.

Anyway, this thick, fruit-filled pancake was delicious, spread with
a bit of [apple butter](/2016/10/sweet-and-chunky-apple-butter.html).
The interior was soft and tender, but the outside was a little
overcooked. I'd definitely make it again, cooking it less, and with
apples sliced a tad thicker (I used the Breville food processor's
adjustable slicer on setting **3**).
