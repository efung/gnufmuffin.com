For Mother's Day, we had a picnic with family in Spencer Smith Park
in Burlington, underneath the cherry blossoms. Dessert was a New York 
cheesecake, that turned out to be not quite so foolproof.

I'll spare you all the details, but the CI
[recipe](http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/lifestyle/20150113/food-for-thought-the-key-to-a-better-cheesecake)
reverses the standard baking technique, by starting out at a low 
temperature, then raising it at the end. I know my oven is not true: 
ever since we lost one of the convection fans, it hasn't worked quite 
right. I also don't have an oven thermometer to check its accuracy.
In hindsight, it seems obvious that the cheesecake wouldn't turn
out perfectly, given that the directions state that measuring the
temperature of the oven and the cheesecake are essential for success.

I needed almost thirty extra minutes before the internal temperature
of the batter reached 165&deg;F, raising the temperature of my oven
25&deg;F every time I checked. As you can see, however, I messed up
during the browning part. I walked away for just a minute to let it get
darker, and it got way too dark, beyond edible. Using a serrated blade, 
we sliced off the tops before serving.

Accompanied by a fresh strawberry topping (just strawberries macerated
in sugar, thickened with strawberry jam), this was a cheesecake to rival
[my favourite cheesecake](/2010/05/yogurt-cheesecake.html). I would
definitely make this again, once I've gotten my oven fixed and purchased
an [oven
thermometer](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/1284-oven-thermometers).
