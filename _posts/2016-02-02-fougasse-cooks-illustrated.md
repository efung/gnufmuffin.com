I learned a lot about baking bread from Peter Reinhart's [The Bread
Baker's Apprentice](/tag/the-bread-bakers-apprentice/), and that
book is where I first encountered _fougasse_. I don't think I've
made it since a
[class](http://www.gnufmuffin.com/2007/12/intl-breads-6-fougasse-and-herb-bread.html)
at George Brown. But when the most recent issue of Cook's Illustrated 
landed in our mailbox, I was curious to read about their take on
this bread.

The [recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8720-fougasse) in 
the March 2016 issue describes fougasse as a "bread made for
crust-lovers". Their ingredient list incorporates a small amount
of whole wheat flour for flavour, but has you sift out the bran to
avoid its sharp edges from compromising the gluten network.  I
didn't follow the initial stretching and resting times strictly,
sometimes letting the dough relax for over an hour, sometimes for
just half an hour. I did leave it to ferment in the fridge from
Sunday afternoon, to Tuesday morning, about 36 hours in total.

I had a bit of trouble rolling the stretched dough back out a triangle
of the dimensions they described (8" base, 10" sides). It tended to
spring back. The smaller size also meant it was harder for me to make
all the cuts. Another deviation from the recipe was accelerating the 
resting times, since I was making this on a weekday morning, and needed
to get my children to school on time.

The baked flatbreads were beautifully browned, and while the openings
weren't very pronounced, there was definitely a lot of crispy crust. I
sprinkled my loaves with kosher salt (as I didn't have any other coarse 
salt) which meant that every bite was deliciously salty. My kids
couldn't get enough of it.

Fougasse is more work to shape than a _boule_ or _bâtard_, but it
definitely has more visual appeal. Plus, the extra surface area yields
more crust, which is a Good Thing™.
