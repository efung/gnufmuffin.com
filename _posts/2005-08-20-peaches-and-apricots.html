Notes: I made this with all 10% cream so it wasn't very rich. Peaches were very ripe, but since no weight was given, I don't think I used enough, so the flavour wasn't very intense.</p><br /><p class="outdent"><b>Pastries</b>: Recipe from <span style="font-style: italic;">Baking with Julia</span> by Dorie Greenspan. Notes: Combination of flaky pastry, smooth pastry cream and sweet-tart apricots is incredibly yummy. Apricots don't need to be poached for longer than a few minutes, they tend to fall apart otherwise.</p><br /><p class="outdent"><b>Jelly</b>: Recipe from <span style="font-style: italic;">Shunju: New Japanese Cuisine</span> by Takashi Sugimoto and Marcia Iwatate. Notes: Peaches are grated so the texture is chunky (unlike the photo in the book). I used gelatin powder instead of leaf gelatin, about 5 g. Blackstrap molasses is <b>not</b> a good substitute for palm sugar, the syrup tasted terrible.
