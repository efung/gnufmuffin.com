excerpt: "I had my doubts about this recipe: 4 cups of flour, 2 eggs and a whole lot of sugar. But the combination of plum and marzipan sounded good, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.  I purchased the marzipan in bulk from Domino\'s; a staff member told me it had 66% almonds, and is less sweet than the stuff"

But the combination of plum and marzipan sounded good, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.  I purchased the marzipan in bulk from <a href="http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/vendors/vendor_detail/64">Domino's</a>; a staff member told me it had 66% almonds, and is less sweet than the stuff that comes in tubes. I roasted four, very ripe plumcots with a few tablespoons of sugar: the compote ended up being too sweet. Despite my best efforts at minimal mixing, the muffins came out a bit dense and tough. I should just go ahead and always use cake flour in my muffins. As I suspected, they were too sweet, and not that remarkable. While the delicious tartness from the plums is a great foil for the marzipan, I wasn't that impressed by this muffin.
