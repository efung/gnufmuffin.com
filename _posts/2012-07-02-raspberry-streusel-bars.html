We got two quarts of strawberry at a farmers' market, and I realized I had never made these bars before, and that it would be a great contribution to the potluck. In case there were kids with allergies, I omitted the pecans from the topping. The best thing about these bars is the sweet-tart contrast. Each bite of the buttery shortbread is complemented by the tangy filling, and the contrasting streusel. These are a more of an adult treat (what can compete with those two-bite chocolate brownies for a child's mouth?), and I would definitely make these bars again.
