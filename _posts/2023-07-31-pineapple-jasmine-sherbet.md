Before I returned it to the library, the last recipe I made out of 
[Hello, My Name is Ice Cream](https://www.hellomynameisicecream.com/), 
was a sherbet. It required a lot of patience and effort, but this
floral, tropical frozen dessert was worth.

The [recipe](https://www.weallscream.net/post/163060886931/7162017-happy-national-ice-cream-day-i) calls for concentrating the juice of two
fresh pineapples. I wasn't sure what the best way of doing that was,
but I blitzed the peeled, cored fruit in a blender, then pushed it
through a sieve by hand. This took a long time, and the resulting
juice was quite foamy.

One learning I had from this experience was infusing the tea in the
milk mixture. I went to a specialty store, Ten Ren, to get a small tin of 
[jasmine pearls](https://www.tenren.com/pearl-jasmine.html). This
pricey ingredient promised an intense fragrance, but the recipe also
cautioned not to infuse for too long. Unfortunately, with around 5 minutes
of steeping, the pearls had not fully unfurled, and did not impart much
flavour to the ice cream base.

Still, this sherbet was fantastic. The intensity of the pineapple
flavour is what you notice right away. And if I can coax more jasmine
flavour out of the tea next time, that would elevate this to 
perfection. One slight distraction is the detectable taste of the
milk powder I used. All of the recipes in the book use it to improve
texture, and it seems to work, as the sherbet was still fairly easy
to scoop even after a few weeks in the freezer.
