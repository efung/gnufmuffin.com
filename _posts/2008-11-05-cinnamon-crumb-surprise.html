excerpt: "With the last of the Empire apples we picked, I decided to make a double batch of this quick bread. Whoops, I gave away the surprise (filling)! I didn\'t have any bleached cake flour, so I mixed together unbleached pastry and AP flours. The crumble topping got fairly hard in the fridge, but a few pokes"

Whoops, I gave away the surprise (filling)! I didn't have any bleached cake flour, so I mixed together unbleached pastry and AP flours. The crumble topping got fairly hard in the fridge, but a few pokes with a fork broke it up again. As for the cake batter, the fat and flour is mixed together first, rather than creaming the butter with the sugar. To avoid making it too rich, I cut the sugar for the batter in half. Although the recipe calls for a 9&times;5" loaf pan, I would do this again with a smaller one, as the finished cake came out very short and squat. The texture of this cake is very fine and the apples and crumble topping are fantastic together. No one at the office complained about the reduced sugar, so I would recommend this change.
