In the realm of "easy" desserts, there are a number of books that
offer "5-minute" recipes, or "5-ingredient" recipes. However, I
snobbishly avoid these, as they usually compromise on flavour, or
require using compound ingredients like pre-made frosting or store-bought
sponge cake. So it was with some amazement and delight, that we
discovered this dairy-free, Passover-friendly, **one**-ingredient dessert.

Hervé This has experimented with, and written about, the science of cooking.
His seminal book, Molecular Gastronomy, sits, unread, on my shelf at home. So
seeing his name attached to a dessert recipe caught my eye. How could
you make a chocolate mousse without dairy?

I needed to make about a dozen small servings, but I decided to do a test
run first. There's a number of recipes out there, but I don't recall which 
one I used. I'll include links to a few here, with their ratio of chocolate
to water for reference:

- [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014542-bittersweet-chocolate-mousse-with-fleur-de-sel) (1.14)

I whipped up (literally) a batch by hand, but it remained quite
loose, despite many strong arms taking turns to whisk.  After fifteen
minutes, we decided to add in more melted chocolate, which improved
things considerably. We used these new proportions for the second
batch, which came together a lot quicker. You'll need to experiment,
since the fat and cocoa content will vary among chocolates.

Predictably, this chocolate dessert was gobbled up immediately. Everyone
loved that it only had one ingredient. The quality of your chocolate is key,
as there's nothing to hide behind!
