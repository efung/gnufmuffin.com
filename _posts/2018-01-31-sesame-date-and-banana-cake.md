A tahini frosting was not something I'd ever made nor eaten before, so
this recipe was top of mind this week when I came across it. Even though
this cake incorporates some of my favourite ingredients (bananas, dates),
overall it was a letdown, and was not enjoyed by my testers either.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018781-sesame-date-and-banana-cake)
can be found in the New York Times. A few notable things in the cake batter
include thinly sliced bananas (not mashed), tahini _and_ toasted sesame seeds,
and orange juice.

As to be expected from an Ottolenghi recipe, there are a lot of ingredients that
even I did not have on hand, including date syrup, and mascarpone. I was not
able to get the former this week, but did use the latter for the frosting.
It was this sesame icing that I felt was the weakest part of the dessert:
the raw tahini flavour was just not appealing. And I found the cake
itself somewhat dense, and the tiny crunch of seeds was not welcome.
