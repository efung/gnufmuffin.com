My wife sent this New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/dining/chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe-instagram.html?_r=0) about an "Internet-famous" cookie. Despite spending
a lot of time on the Web, I'm not on Insta, so this cookie did not come
across my radar until a few months ago. I finally had a chance to make it
over the holiday break, and boy, was it fun to bake and eat!

The unusual technique in this [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018945-giant-crinkled-chocolate-chip-cookies), due to Sarah Kieffer, is the **pan bang**. While the cookies are baking, you open the oven 
door and firmly rap the sheet on the rack, causing the still-puffing dough to collapse. Read
the NYT article or [her blog](http://www.thevanillabeanblog.com/2017/10/pan-banging-chocolate-chip-cookies.html) for more details!

I cut back on the white sugar a bit, to a scant 1Â¼ cups without
a noticeable flavour loss. Down here in Florida, there's no digital
scale in these kitchens. So, without any way to weigh the dough balls,
I relied on a volumetric measurement. My total output was 12 cookies,
two more than the yield in the recipe. The slightly smaller diameter of
mine might account for why there aren't as many ridges as I expected.

Taste-wise though, these cookies were exactly as promised: soft, gooey centre, 
with crisp edges. These were a resounding success, all dozen cookies devoured
by guests in minutes. I look forward to making more batches of these in the
future.
