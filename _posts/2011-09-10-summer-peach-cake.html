excerpt: "We\'ve been buying a lot of peaches and nectarines recently. My aunt from Edmonton was in town and we had her over for dinner. This cake was simple to put together for when I got home from work. It uses ground almonds, giving it a marzipan kind of flavour. I used yogurt mixed with milk instead of buttermilk"

My aunt from Edmonton was in town and we had her over for dinner. This cake was simple to put together for when I got home from work. It uses ground almonds, giving it a marzipan kind of flavour. I used yogurt mixed with milk instead of buttermilk (who ever has buttermilk on hand?) It comes out a little moist, but utterly delicious in my opinion.
