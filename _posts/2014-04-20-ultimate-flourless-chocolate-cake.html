excerpt: "On Saturday morning, we decided that the pistachio cake might not be enough for all the adults plus children, so I quickly baked this flour-free chocolate cake recipe that had only three ingredients. I used a false bottom 8\" tin, instead of a springform, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed,"

I used a false bottom 8" tin, instead of a springform, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed, adding in the optional Kahl√∫a for flavour. Checking for doneness is easy, as you just need to check the internal temperature. Predictably, this cake was a hit: rich, chocolate flavour, without being too dense or fudgy.
