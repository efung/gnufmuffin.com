I've made treats and shared them with colleagues for as long as I've
been working. There doesn't always need to be an occasion, but it's
a motivating factor. For our quarterly Hack Days, I decided to make
some cookies to snack on while hacking.

The original
[recipe](https://www.todaywebake.com/cranberry-oat-and-white-chocolate-cookies/)
is titled **Cranberry**, Oat and White Chocolate Biscuits, but I
made the suggested substitution from the headnote. It's from the
aptly named cookbook, _Sweet: Desserts from London's Ottolenghi_.
There's a lot of wholesome ingredients in here: skin-on whole almonds,
whole wheat flour, old-fashioned rolled oats, and dried fruit. But
let's not kid ourselves: this is definitely a cookie, with its 
generous butter and sugar, along with the white chocolate icing!

Make sure you roast the almonds until they're slightly browned and 
fragrant. Their nuttiness and crunch really add a lot to this
cookie. The completed dough is pretty soft: I chilled the mixer
bowl in the fridge for about 15 minutes before I rolled it out.
I got about 18 cookies in total, as I didn't roll the dough too
thin, and used a fairly large cutter.

These cookies were _good_. I'm the kind of person who prefers oatmeal
to chocolate chip any day, and I'm partial to the kind of cookie
that combines different flavours and textures. This cookie is all
that, plus, it has the bonus of an icing.  The orange zest is quite
noticeable, in a good way, not a flavour one usually tastes in a
cookie.
