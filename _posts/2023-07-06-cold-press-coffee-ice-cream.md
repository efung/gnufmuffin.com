I love cold brew coffee, particularly when made from New Orleans coffee
which has been infused with chicory. When I saw this coffee ice cream
recipe in _Hello, My Name Is Ice Cream_, I was intrigued because it
results in a finished product that is **white** in colour, and promised
to "taste the way coffee smells".

The [recipe](https://lisaiscooking.blogspot.com/2017/08/cold-press-coffee-ice-cream-with-salted.html) is a standard ice cream, that is, made with
egg yolks and cream. After the custard base has cooled, the coffee 
beans infuse in the mixture for 12 hours in the refrigerator. The
author does not specify what roast of beans to use, and what I
had was a medium roast, and I wasn't sure how it would turn out.

I needn't have worried: this ice cream was amazing. The
colour is indeed a creamy white, and the taste is unmistakably
coffee, without any hint of bitterness. All of the frozen desserts
I've been making recently are white, and I can imagine a banana
split with three, visually identical scoops, but with wildly different
flavours.
