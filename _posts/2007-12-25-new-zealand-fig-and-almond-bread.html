There are no instructions for an overnight rise, so after making up the dough, I put it in the fridge for about 4 hours, then punched it down, incorporated the fruit and nuts, then put it back for an overnight rise. It's a heavy dough, and I think there are too many almonds for it to form a cohesive ball. The whole wheat flour was a bit rancid too, so this wasn't a very tasty loaf. It's dense, crumbly and dry. No fresh figs were available at the supermarket, so I just skipped the step of plunging a whole one in the top of the loaf.<br /><br />Here is <a href="http://breadbasketcase.blogspot.com/2006/10/new-zealand-almond-and-fig-bread.html">breadbasket case's loaf</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32356625@N00/1589320618/">musicpb's version</a>.
