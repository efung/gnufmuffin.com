I learned about two (2!) baking supply warehouses this week that were previously unknown to me:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.davidrobertsfood.com/">David Roberts Food Corporation</a> has an outlet store in Mississauga (<a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=david+roberts+food+corporation,+mississauga,+on&ie=UTF8&z=12&ll=43.682522,-79.604187&spn=0.126873,0.263672&om=1&iwloc=A">Google Map</a>). They have a huge assortment of packaged nuts (375 g tub of macadamia nuts for $8!), dried fruit, snacks, gift baskets and more.<br /><li>McCall's Bakers Warehouse is also in Mississauga (<a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=mccall%27s+bakers+warehouse,+mississauga,+on&ie=UTF8&z=12&ll=43.687239,-79.604187&spn=0.126863,0.263672&om=1&iwloc=A">Google map</a>) and they are open to the public over the coming weekend and next (Dec 2, 3). They sell the same products as the <a href="http://mccalls-cakes.com/">McCall's</a> store in Etobicoke, obviously: cake decorating supplies (boxes, icings, colourings, flavourings, decorations), cake tins, chocolate and candy making supplies. They even had chocolate sticks for making pain au chocolat.<br /></ul>
