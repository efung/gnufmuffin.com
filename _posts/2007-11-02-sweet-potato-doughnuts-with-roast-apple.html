I tried making these baked doughnuts to use up some Spy apples and sweet potatoes. The batter contains evaporated milk and I substituted yogurt for buttermilk. After the initial rise, I made the mistake of trying to shape and fill the sticky batter with my hands, rather than scooping it into the muffin tins first as directed. I also had a difficult time gauging the right amount to use and it turns out that just enough batter to enclose the cube of apple is sufficient. These are yeasty-tasting and a little chewy, not like a deep-fried doughnut for sure. The tart, caramelized apple filling is an excellent contrast.
