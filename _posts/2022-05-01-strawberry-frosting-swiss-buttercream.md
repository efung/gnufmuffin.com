My kids get to decide on their birthday dessert, and I try my best
to make their wish a reality. My daughter asked for chocolate
cupcakes with strawberry frosting this year. We always make the same
cupcake recipe ([since 2010!](2010/04/ultimate-chocolate-cupcakes.html))
but I did a bit more research to find a good frosting.

From past experience, a buttercream flavoured with fresh berries
tends to separate and weep. Mixing jam into the frosting works
a bit better, but the flavour is muted. So I was pleased to find
this Stella Parks [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/strawberry-frosting-recipe) that calls for **freeze-dried strawberries**.

In the US, Trader Joe's is a reliable place to get freeze-dried fruit,
but up here, I ended up buying some from an unlikely source: [soursopstore.ca](https://soursopstore.ca/products/freeze-dried-strawberries-50g-pack) Even though it's twice the cost of TJ's, it was still far less expensive than the prices I saw on Amazon. For future price comparison, they were $10 for 50g, purchased in a 5-pack.

Making the Swiss meringue worked exactly as the instructions described,
and I was careful to measure the temperature of my ingredients at
each step.
There's quite a bit of butter to incorporate, but it came together 
without any problem. The final step of adding the pulverized dried fruit 
was delightful, turning the mixture a light pink.

At the party, I was quite surprised that about half the kids did not
eat the frosting. "Too buttery"! And perhaps not sweet enough ðŸ¤”. 
What do they know?
