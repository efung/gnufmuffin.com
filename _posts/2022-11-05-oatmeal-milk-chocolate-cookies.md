This isn't the first time I've made this cookie. Since my Mom
bought me this book many years ago, I've made this oatmeal chocolate
chip cookie maybe a dozen times. We eat them so fast, I don't
even get a chance to take a photo.

The recipe comes from _Duchess Bake Shop_, the first cookbook
by Giselle Courteau. It's not a particular novel recipe, but
I think the addition of cinnamon makes it extra delicious. There's
a generous amount of chewy, large flake oats, and I like
the sweetness from milk chocolate here.

Much like trying new [banana](/tag/banana/) bread recipes, I'm always 
willing to try a new oatmeal cookie recipe. But it's going to be very
hard to surpass this one!
