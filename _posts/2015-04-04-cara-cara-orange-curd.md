Flick and I made all three Seder desserts ahead of time on
Thursday night. For Saturday, we decided to repeat
an old and a new favourite: a [flourless chocolate-orange
cake](/2008/04/flourless-chocolate-orange-almond-cake.html) and a creamy
chocolate pudding. To accompany the former, we made an orange curd.

I found a
[recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-cara-cara-orange-curd-106367)
online that sounded good, and happened to call for
the same kind of orange that we bought at Costco. [Cara
caras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cara_cara_navel) have red, sweet
flesh but their juice is orange-coloured. This recipe calls for
reducing the fresh juice to concentrate the flavour. I worried this
would introduce a boiled taste to the curd, but it didn't turn out that
way.

A double batch was enough to provide a garnish for sixteen slices of
a 9" cake. There wasn't enough orange flavour for my liking: perhaps I
should have used two oranges worth of zest instead of one. A nice change
from lemon curd, and the right accompaniment for this cake.
