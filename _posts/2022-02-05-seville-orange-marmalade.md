I love to buy interesting jams and marmalades, but I love even more
to make my own. It's been many years since I've made a citrus one,
so seeing Seville oranges at [Farm Boy](https://www.farmboy.ca/)
got me excited.

Most of the recipes from my canning books weren't all that
inspiring. I ended up using this [recipe](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/seville-orange/) by David Lebovitz from his website. I used six
Seville oranges plus one Moro blood orange. Removing the pips
was quite a chore, but I ended up with a good half cup of seeds.
These went into a cheesecloth sack, and simmered with the 
laboriously hand-cut peels. As suggested, I left the mixture
sitting at room temperature for most of the day.

In the evening, I started cooking the jam. It took a long time 
to boil off enough water for the temperature to start increasing.
I used slightly less than the recommended amount of sugar.
Despite boiling for almost 45 minutes, I never got above 214â„‰ . The
dish in the freezer test eventually confirmed that I had made a marmalade
that started to gel.

At this point, I was too tired to actually heat process the jars.
I just ladled the marmalade into clean jars, and immersed pieces 
of dried-out vanilla beans. The pods will soften over time, and 
will need a little smushing and scraping to get the tiny seeds out.

I _love_ marmalade and this was probably the best one I've ever made.
The colour is a deep orange, the shreds of peel are just the 
right thickness and length, and the Irish whiskey and vanilla 
adds some subtlety. I froze half of the jars, and put the rest 
in the fridge, and will enjoy spreading it on toast all winter.
