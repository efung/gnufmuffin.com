On to the third cookie of our holiday baking: this one, a mix of 
peanut butter and miso. It turned out salty and chewy, but not
quite satisfying to me.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020538-peanut-butter-miso-cookies)
is an older New York Times one. I forgot, but this isn't the first time I've made
a cookie with this combination: a 
[previous experiment](https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2011/01/peanut-butter-miso-cookies.html) 
was done all the way back in 2011. Anyway, for this recipe, I used a natural 
chunky peanut butter, organic white (shiro) miso, and skipped rolling the huge balls
of dough in Demerara sugar (as I don't have any).

I liked doing the pan-banging technique on these huge cookies. They were still
quite chewy hours later. Some of our friends loved these. To me, they were
too mellow and blended the individual flavours too much. Maybe I would
like a miso cookie that was topped with chopped peanuts?
