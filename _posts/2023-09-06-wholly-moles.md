I was unnaturally excited about a cookie made with garlic powder, cocoa 
nibs, and currants. But everyone else? Not so much.

According to the authors of _Fabulous Modern Cookies_, these little
chocolatey bites are meant to evoke a Mexican 
[mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(sauce)) sauce. The 
blend of spices called for includes garam masala,
as a shortcut to incorporating some of the spices common to
both Mexican and Indian dishes.

The texture of these cookies is quite soft and crumbly. And the 
add-ins (black sesame seeds, cocoa nibs, currants) left you needing
to rinse your mouth out.

But it was the taste that was extremely polarizing. Some people
(ahem, my family) took one bit and went "Blech!", while others
(bless you Paige and Neil) loved it. I sampled and served these over 
a week. But in the end, overwhelmed by the teasing and scrunched
up faces, I gave in and tossed the last few into the compost bin.
