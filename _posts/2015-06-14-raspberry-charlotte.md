From time to time, we get invited to dinner, and invited to make dessert
for the occasion. This weekend, our contribution was a raspberry
charlotte from a recent issue of Cook's Illustrated.

There are two insights from the magazine: one, using a chiffon cake
is sturdier and easier than making ladyfingers or jelly rolls to line
the outside of the pan; two, instead of a standard Bavarian cream, which
can be heavy and springy, a raspberry curd blended with whipped cream
achieves the perfect texture.

Another clever idea is baking the cake batter in a round pan for the
bottom, and a square pan for the sides. The square is cut into four
rectangular strips that form the perimeter of the charlotte. Since the
layers are thin, the baking time is very short.

You need to follow the cake pan sizes exactly, as there isn't a lot
of room for adjustment. The 8" cake will fit perfectly in a 9" springform
band, leaving just enough room for the rectangular strips to make
a snug fit. The strips also line the circumference exactly. Definitely
measure and portion 1 cup of batter for the round cake pan, as you want
the square cake to be thicker.

The filling is not too complicated, but does involve a lot of bowls.
Straining the curd through a sieve has the added benefit of removing the
raspberry seeds, which I liked.

At the dinner, this dessert got a lot of compliments. The raspberry
flavour in the filling was quite pure, and the cake was delicate but
held up to the filling. Five stars, would make again.

Truc, the blogger behind Treats, has the 
[recipe](http://www.treats-sf.com/2015/02/raspberry-charlotte.html) on
her blog, as well as great photos of the exterior and interior of this
cake.

I definitely overdid it on the decorations. Not only did I use fresh
raspberries to garnish the top, as well as the marbled jam effect, but I
also made chocolate curls (see [this
guide](http://www.callebaut.com/usen/techniques/decorations/chocolate-curls)
for a tutorial), as well as patterned chocolate discs. Here's a
