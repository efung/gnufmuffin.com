A lemony short crust, custard filling, and heaps of apples: they all sounded
good together. We were attending a potluck and offered to bring a dessert, and
this kuchen, from a trusted author, fit the bill for being impressive and homey.
Alas, it was a bit of a disappointment and didn't meet my expectations.

This [recipe](http://www.capturedfromscratch.com/theblog//an-apple-custard-tourte) 
is from Dorie Greenspan's cookbook about desserts that people in France might
make at home. I followed it verbatim with the exception of not using raisins.

From looking at the [Tuesdays with Dorie](https://tuesdayswithdorie.wordpress.com/bcm-completed-recipes/) 
people who made this on Sept 22, 2015, many
of them complained about the crust. It's definitely soft and tricky to work with, and
I don't think anyone just pressed the round into the springform without it tearing.
For a dough this pliable, you definitely have to chill it to firm it up before baking.

Pre-roasting the apples (I used Honeycrisp) gives them a head start,
and is key for many baked apple desserts. Unfortunely, mine stayed
quite firm and that's likely the root of what I didn't like about
this dessert. Dorie's headnote says that "what's inside the crust
is almost spoonable and certainly comforting". I imagined a more
homogenous texture but my tourte turned out to have a clear distinction
between fruit and custard.
