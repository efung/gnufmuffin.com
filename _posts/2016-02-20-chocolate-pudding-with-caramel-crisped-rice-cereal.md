For a spur-of-the-moment dinner for guests on Saturday night, I
wanted to have a make-ahead sweet course to leave time for the
other dishes. This pudding was easy to make, and the two
garnishes really elevated the dessert.

The
[recipe](www.cookstr.com/recipes/spiced-chocolate-pudding-with-caramel-crisped-rice-cereal)
is from Pichet Ong's [In The Sweet Kitchen](/tag/in-the-sweet-kitchen/).
The original calls for cardamom and star anise, but we didn't think
the under-five crowd would enjoy those flavours, so I omitted them.
To speed up making the pudding, I melted the chocolate and butter
together in the microwave, then poured the heated cream over top,
stirring until it was smooth. I portioned the mixture into tea cups
and ramekins, then let it refrigerate.

Next, I made the drunken cherries. Two pounds seemed like a lot for a
garnish, so I ended up making a quarter of this recipe. I microwaved
some frozen black cherries, draining (and drinking) any juice that was
released. I mixed the fruit with balsamic vinegar, vanilla extract,
red wine, and Kirschwasser (the recipe calls for sake, which I did not
have on hand).

The caramelized puffed rice was my favourite part: you make a caramel
from sugar, corn syrup and butter, taking it just past the [hard
crack stage](http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/sugar-stages.html),
so that the caramel will be solid after it cools. After stirring in
the cereal, it needs to be spread thinly on a silicone mat, so 
that it doesn't harden into large clumps.

To serve, I placed the cup and ramekins in a shallow bowl of very hot
water for about 5 seconds, and then inverted each one over a plate.
After just 4 hours in the fridge, the pudding didn't set completely:
I should have cooled it over ice first. But leftovers on subsequent
days were the proper consistency. The pudding itself was surprisingly
bitter, enough so that my kids didn't like it. That's not surprising,
since there's no added sugar in the pudding, only the sweetness
from the chocolate (mine was 72%). Combined with the tart-boozy
cherries, and sweet, crunchy Krispies, this was a really, really good
dessert, but perhaps not the best one for children.
