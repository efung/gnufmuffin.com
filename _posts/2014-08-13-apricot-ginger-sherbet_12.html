Partly because they're in season for a very short time here, and partly because I know that none of the varieties I have access to would even come close to what he describes he tasted. In any case, I decided to buy a basket to turn into a frozen dessert.<a name='more'></a><p>Using the apricot cardamom sherbet recipe from <i>Frozen Desserts</i> (by Caroline Liddell and Robin Weir) as a guide, I gently cooked a pound and a half of apricots in a syrup, along with a half-inch piece of ginger. After letting it cool a bit, I pureed the mixture, forgetting to remove the hunk of ginger. A mesh strainer didn't pick up very many chunks, as the Vitamix completely pulverized the skin and fibre of the fruit. After a night in the fridge, I added milk, but omitted the beaten egg white.</p><p>The resulting sherbet froze hard enough, that it required 15 minutes on the counter to be soft enough to scoop. The flavour, well, without mincing words: it tasted a bit like baby food. It's doesn't have a rich mouthfeel like ice cream does, nor does it have a purity of flavour that a sorbet has. An interesting experiment, but I don't know that I would make more sherbets.
