Another year, another virtual holiday celebrationâ€¦ I found a flourless
cake that greatly appealed to me, but was unsure whether the rest
of my family would enjoy it. Turns out, everyone LOVED this super
moist, super tender cake.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013089-almond-cake-with-cardamom-and-pistachio)
is from the New York Times cooking website, and is kosher for Passover. I didn't
have quite enough almond extract (just a half teaspoon), but I found the cake
had plenty of nutty flavour. Don't worry too much about the stiff batter, and
persevere when gently folding the whites in.

Despite what felt like a really heavy batter, this baked up relatively
light as almond cakes go. I imagine the half cup of oil helped.
Despite using two teaspoons of cardamom, I barely tasted it. Maybe
my powdered spice needs replacing?

This cake keeps remarkably well. Even many days later, the slices
we helped ourselves to stayed moist. Eaten plain, it was wonderful. Lemon
curd spooned over top made it extra wonderful!
