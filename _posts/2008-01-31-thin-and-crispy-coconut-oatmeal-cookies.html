excerpt: "My only change to the recipe was using cultured butter rather than regular. This may have caused the cookies to puff up rather than spread out. As I turned the pan in the oven, I gave it a sharp rap which helped to deflate the cookies somewhat. I also needed about 5 extra minutes to get them browned."

This may have caused the cookies to puff up rather than spread out. As I turned the pan in the oven, I gave it a sharp rap which helped to deflate the cookies somewhat. I also needed about 5 extra minutes to get them browned. The flavour seemed off somewhat (likely the cultured butter) but they were indeed buttery and crispy.
