excerpt: "This is the third time I\'ve made this cake in the past few weeks. It\'s that good. There\'s just enough batter to bind a bunch of apple slices together, and no spices or nuts to mask the pure fruit flavour. It\'s reminiscent of the Bolzano Apple Cake but a little more substantial and less work.Here"

It's that good. There's just enough batter to bind a bunch of apple slices together, and no spices or nuts to mask the pure fruit flavour. It's reminiscent of the <a href="/2006/12/bolzano-apple-cake.html">Bolzano Apple Cake</a> but a little more substantial and less work.<br /><br />Here are some notes: The cake tasted fine with one yolk instead of two in the bottom batter; this reduces the number of leftover <a href="/search/label/eggwhites">egg whites</a>. Sugar sprinkled on top merely adds a crunchy topping, so omit it to reduce the total sugar. Use a firm, baking apple like Cortland or Golden Delicious: a variety like McIntosh turns to mush in the microwave, but the finished cake will still be alright, just wetter. The cake is a bit oily, so reduce it a bit. Highly recommended.
