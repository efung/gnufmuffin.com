This cookie got consumed so fast, I didn't get a chance to take its
portrait. The blend of almond and pistachio in a pleasing swirl was
the hands-down winner for me.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021709-pistachio-pinwheels)
is in the NYT, but is adapted from Claire Saffitz' _Dessert Person_.
It's a rich, buttery dough, with the addition of ground nuts. While
watching something on TV, I shelled the unsalted pistachios, then tried
to remove as much of the skins as possible.

I like that you can do the whole thing in the food processor. After blitzing
everything together, two thirds of the dough gets mixed with almond flour, 
and the remainders gets blitzed some more with the pulverized pistachios. 
After rolling and chilling the almond layer, you spread on the still-soft 
pistachio dough, and roll the whole thing up!

I was busy with another cookie, so forgot to visually check these at
the minimum bake time. Oops, they browned too much, so I think I lost
the colour contrast. Or maybe it's because I didn't peel enough of the
skins, or maybe I should blanch the nuts first.

The taste is what really matters though. They're really crumbly,
extremely nutty and delicious. Highly recommend, and I will definitely 
repeat this one.
