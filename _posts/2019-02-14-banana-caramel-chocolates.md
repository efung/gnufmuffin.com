Sometimes, I make chocolates for Valentine's Day and share them. But this 
week, my motivation was a ski getaway for the Family Day long weekend, during
which much junk food and sweets were consumed.

The recipe comes from _Making Artisan Chocolates_ and is marked **DIFFICULT**. 
There are three two sub-recipes to make for the filling, then dipping
and finishing. It's a lot of steps, but I didn't find it hard, just 
time-consuming.

To make the first component, the banana pur√©e, you just blend bananas and 
icing sugar. I used an immersion blender, and didn't bother to strain 
the mixture. The other component is a caramel crunch: it's just granulated
sugar and corn syrup, heated until amber, then poured onto a Silpat,
then flattened with another silicone sheet. Once cool, the caramel is 
pulverized in a food processor. I ended up with a lot of dust, rather than a
coarse powder.

The ganache filling combines the above two items, with white chocolate, 
milk chocolate, cocoa butter, cream, butter, rum and vanilla! I can
see how a long ingredient list can deter a casual chocolatier, but 
I can tell you the results are worth the effort.

Once the ganache was made, I let it cool at room temperature, eventually 
using the fridge to speed things up. Once it was firm, I used a small
cookie scoop to portion out the filling. It needs to dry out overnight
before it can be rolled and dipped.

The next evening, I tempered some chocolate, then put on some cotton
chocolate handling gloves, to roll the ganache centres into rounds.
Immediately after dipping each center, I rolled them in a 50:50 
mixture of cocoa powder and sugar.

I can't believe how well balanced this chocolate is. Even with my 
less-than-ripe bananas, the flavor is pronounced and distinctive.
However, there was no evidence of any crunch at all; I think the 
ganache contains too much liquid so the sugar dissolved.
Next time, I'll save some time and effort by skipping the caramel.
