excerpt: "Both the soaker and the biga require potato water to soften and flavour the final bread. I added roasted garlic and freshly ground black pepper as suggested, as well as using chopped fresh rosemary. This dough was very soft to work with and did not rise that much. There is a wonderful savoury quality"

I added roasted garlic and freshly ground black pepper as suggested, as well as using chopped fresh rosemary. This dough was very soft to work with and did not rise that much. There is a wonderful savoury quality to this bread that would make it perfect for croutons or for sandwiches or for serving with soup. On the evening after I baked it, the texture was almost &ldquo;squeaky&rdquo;!
