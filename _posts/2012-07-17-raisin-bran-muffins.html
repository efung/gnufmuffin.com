excerpt: "We happened to have a jumbo box of Raisin Bran (it always seems like I\'m trying to use up one ingredient or another) at home. Dr. S doesn\'t like raisins, and I do, but I wasn\'t going to eat that much cereal. So I hunted around for a recipe and found this muffin one. Ugh, these were gross. Dense, spongy,"

Dr. S doesn't like raisins, and I do, but I wasn't going to eat that much cereal. So I hunted around for a recipe and found this muffin one. Ugh, these were gross. Dense, spongy, flavourless. They'll be fine slathered with jam and butter, but I would not make these again.
