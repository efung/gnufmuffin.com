I filtered the reserved frying oil through cheesecloth, and kept it frozen. Surprisingly, the combination of sunflower and canols oils actually solidified in the jar.<br /><br />This recipe is interesting because it uses evaporated milk in the dough. After cutting the rolled dough into small squares, I plopped teaspoons of cherry or blueberry jam on alternate squares, then made little ravioli-style packets. It was difficult to seal them as the dough was sticky and the wet jam was slippery.<br /><br />As they fried, many of the fritters leaked their contents, producing slowly darkening bits of burnt sugar and jam bits. The next time I make doughnuts, I'm definitely going to fill them afterwards with a piping bag. Nevertheless, these doughnuts were pretty good. I don't think evaporated milk enhanced the flavour of these, so I wouldn't necessarily make this recipe again.
