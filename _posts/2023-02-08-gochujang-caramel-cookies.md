When I used to go into an office, I'd bring in desserts for people
to sample. At my first job, there was even a mailing list of dedicated
eaters who would always come to sample and give feedback. This past
week, for a rare in-person event at work, I made three kinds of
cookies and brought one each day.

The first one was an almond variation on the 
[Macau-style cookies](/2023/01/chocolate-hazelnut-macau-style-cookies.html)
I first made the week before. For Day 2, I went with gochujang caramel cookies. 
Dr. S actually said it's the best cookie I've ever made for her,
which is shocking since it contains no chocolate.

The [recipe](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/food/story/new-york-times-gochujang-caramel-cookie-recipe-95218270) is by Eric Kim, a writer
for the New York Times Food section. You can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B43W_wXJuY) him explain and make the cookies on YouTube.

Of course, if you're a regular reader of this blog, you know I will
always try anything unusual or unexpected. And using a fermented,
spicy-sweet Korean chili paste in a _cookie_ definitely attracted my
attention. These aren't hard to make, but do pay close attention 
to the tips given in the recipe and video. In particular, the swirling
of the chili caramel needs a deft touch.

These cookies turned out chewy and moist, with a gentle build-up of heat
and a nice lingering buttery finish. They spread out quite a bit, so even
half is plenty, but they're very irresistible. I would definitely
make these again, especially as part of an assortment. Highly
recommended.
