It was for corn ice cream, which is an unconventional flavour, but one I knew I had to try. Unlike, say, some of <a href="http://tk-www.elcom.nitech.ac.jp/~jayks712/icecream/icecream.htm">these <i>seafood</i> based flavours</a>.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/recipes/caesar-guintos-homemade-corn-ice-cream/article19929367/">recipe</a> in the paper is attributed to a chef from Simcoe County. The yield was way too  much for my ice cream machine, but a half batch was perfect. I started by stripping the kernels from four ears of  corn using <a href="http://www.oxo.com/p-482-corn-stripper.aspx">yet another tool</a> acquired after we got married. These, along with the cobs, went to simmer with the cream and milk. After reheating the corn-infused liquid, I tempered the egg yolks and sugar, then cooked the combined mixture until 185&deg;F. It never really coated the back of a spoon for me, but I didn't want to risk scrambling the custard. <br /><br />Once off heat, I poured everything (including the corn niblets) into a blender and ran it until all the corn was smooth, and the liquid turned foamy. After tasting a spoonful, we decided to strain the mixture to get out all of the fibrous hull. At this stage, I also found the custard to be quite sweet. For the compote, I simmered a pint of wild blueberries with a bit of sugar and water, reserving some of the fruit so that some of the berries would stay whole.<br /><br />The next night, I was ready to assemble the dessert. I took a handful of salted, toasted corn and chopped it in a mini food processor. Making the praline seemed excessive, given the sweetness of the ice cream already. To serve, I put two small scoops in the bottom of a glass, spooning the compote around the ice cream, and topped it with a little toasted corn. Flick and I both agreed that it's an interesting dessert, one that we both had no hesitation in trying, but also one in which we wouldn't necessarily need to make again. I think a better way to eat the corn ice cream would be in a sandwich, with the sides made from <a href="/2013/11/corn-cookies.html">corn cookies</a>!
