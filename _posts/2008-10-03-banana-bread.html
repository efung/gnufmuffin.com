excerpt: "An experiment using Splenda Brown Sugar Blend last week didn\'t turn out so well. Using my favourite recipe, I replaced the sugar with half the volume of the Splenda blend. The critical error was in using underripe bananas. I tried really hard to ripen them but in the end, the banana flavour was muted"

Using my <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2005/09/chteau-banana-bread.html">favourite</a> recipe, I replaced the sugar with half the volume of the Splenda blend. The critical error was in using underripe bananas. I tried really hard to ripen them but in the end, the banana flavour was muted and the texture quite dense. After coming home on Wednesday to an apartment heady with the smell of ripening fruit, I made a double batch of this banana bread instead. My substitutions were using a mix of sour cream and buttermilk instead of yogurt, and a mix of gluten-free and regular AP flour. While the loaf was tasty and full of flavour, it still doesn't surpass my tried and true recipe. I'll have to come back to the Splenda experiment, which I undertook to make a diabetic-friendly version for Dr. S' dad.
