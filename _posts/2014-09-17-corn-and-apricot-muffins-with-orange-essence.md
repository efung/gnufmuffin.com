I entered “sour cream” and “muffin” into the Eat Your Books search
last night, and uncovered a recipe for corn muffins in Cook's
Illustrated dating back to September 2002 that I hadn't made before.
A check of my back issues revealed that I had a copy and I skimmed
the article which promised a moist, delicious muffin. We had all
the ingredients to make the apricot and orange variation, so on a
Wednesday morning before work, I set out to make a batch.

The
[recipe](http://www.cooking.com/recipes-and-more/recipes/corn-and-apricot-muffins-with-orange-essence-recipe-7623.aspx#axzz3DdH6jaR6) was published before Cook's Illustrated started to simplify
and take shortcuts in many recipes. Hence, even for a humble muffin, I had
to use no less than three separate bowls and two food processors. 

First up, I tried chopping the dried apricots in the mini-chop. No go:
the blade spun ineffectually below the irregular and sticky pieces.
After switching to the full-size food processor, the apricots were
reduced to small pieces in short order. I juiced about 5 or 6
clementines to get the required amount of liquid. After microwaving the
mixture and letting it soak, I wasn't able to drain any excess liquid
out of the macerated fruit.

Back in the mini-chop, I blitzed sugar with clementine zest that I
removed using a Microplane. Two-thirds cup sounded like an excessive
amount to sprinkle on a dozen muffins, so I only used a scant half cup.
This turned out to be more than enough; the leftover will be a delicious
alternative for sweetening tea or coffee.

There is a discussion of how not all cornmeals are alike. They
specifically talk about whole-grain versus degerminated cornmeal 
(which affects flavour), and fine versus coarse grinds (which affects
texture). My bag happened to be a stone-ground, whole-grain cornmeal.
The only other substitution I made was minor: I made up a small
shortage in sour cream, with Greek yogurt plus heavy cream.

I needed a few extra minutes in the oven before a toothpick came out
clean. The muffins rose nicely, with large domed tops, and a deep golden
colour.
