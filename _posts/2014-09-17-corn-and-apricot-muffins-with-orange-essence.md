A search of “sour cream” and ”muffins” in Eat Your Books brought up a
muffin recipe I hadn't made before. They promised a tender, moist muffin
with lots of flavour and a sprinkle of sugar on top. On a weekday morning, 
I attempted to make them for breakfast, but they turned out to be more 
work than I anticipated.

The original [recipe](http://makeourdailybread.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/corn-and-apricot-muffins-with-orange-essence/) comes from Cook's Illustrated in their Sep 2002 issue. 
My first step was to chop up the dried apricots. I literally had a mixed
bag: some tart, dark orange ones in the fridge, and some plump, regular
store-bought ones.  Trying to dice these in a mini food processor was
ineffectual. I ended up using the full-size one. We don't usually have
orange juice in the fridge, so I had to juice 5 or 6 clementines. After
microwaving the apricot-juice mixture, and letting it sit for 5 minutes,
all of the liquid was absorbed.  I kept the mini-chop out, and used it
to make the orange sugar. Two-thirds of a cup sounded like a lot for a
dozen muffins, so I reduced the amount to a scant half cup.

The magazine article talks about the effect of degerminated vs
whole-grain cornmeal (flavour) and coarse vs fine grain (texture). I
happened to be using a coarse, whole-grain cornmeal and was satisfied
with both the flavour and texture.

Overall, the muffins turned out as promised: tender and moist, not dry
and crumbly. I found the apricots I was using to be too tart, but liked
that the finely chopped fruit meant you tasted a few pieces in every
bite. The orange sugar is a nice touch, but does raise the sweetness
level. While the muffins were a success, it's no wonder that they taste
good, with the inclusion of sour cream, butter and sugar in the
recipe.
