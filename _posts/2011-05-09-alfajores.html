A cookie with a dulce de leche filling sounded scrumptious. During the winter, we happened to walk by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blogto.com/cafes/el-almacen-toronto">El Almacen</a>&nbsp;before seeing a play at The Great Hall. Spotting a sign advertising alfajor, I added one to our lunch order. They were incredibly soft and light, like a good shortbread, with a delicious caramel filling.<br /><br />I had my eye on the&nbsp;<a href="http://leitesculinaria.com/7499/recipes-dulce-de-leche-sandwich-cookies-alfajores.html">recipe</a>&nbsp;on Leite's Culinaria but&nbsp;didn't have cream cheese handy. That's how I ended up using this Martha Stewart recipe for my first attempt. Unfortunately, the finished product fell far short of my expectations.<br /><br />Firstly, the batter resembles a biscuit more than a cookie. No matter what I did, I couldn't get mine to turn out like the flattened round discs in the photos or the accompanying video. The insides were tender like cake with a bit of chew. Definitely not the melt-in-your-mouth texture I was after.<br /><br />Oh well, The Office enjoyed them. But I will definitely try making alfajores again with a different recipe.
