These past two weeks, I have been nurturing a sourdough starter
using the directions in [Bouchon Bakery](/tag/Bouchon%20Bakery).
Using the liquid levain I've been feeding on a daily (sometimes
twice-daily) basis, I made four loaves of walnut bread this week,
perhaps the best bread I've ever made. I'll write more about the 
sourdough starter in another post this week, so I can just focus 
on these amazing loaves.

The dough contains a small amount of rye and whole wheat flours, but is
otherwise a white flour bread. Using a modest amount of liquid levain,
the only additional leavening is an eighth of a teaspoon of instant
yeast. The kneading time is 20 minutes on low in the stand mixer (I used
Speed 2 on my KitchenAid). At the end, I added untoasted walnuts.

This is bread that you have to plan ahead for. For this walnut
bread, there is a fermentation period of three hours in which you
need to stretch and fold the dough every hour. After that, you let
it proof for another three hours. The photo above was shot after this
proofing period.

I bought a _lame_ and linen _couche_ from
[Breadtopia](http://breadtopia.com) and used them to make
this bread. As suggested in the recipe, I slit the loaves in a “sausage
cut” just before baking. I wasn't about to implement Bouchon's rocks and
chain method of generating steam, so I just put a cast iron pan in the
oven, and poured boiling water into it after placing the bread on the
stone.

The finished loaves were nicely browned and grew to a nice size. I was
quite pleased with the crisp crust. The interior was airy and soft, and
every bite had walnuts. While the sourdough flavour was mild, it was
definitely noticeable.

I mentioned at the beginning that I made four loaves of this bread. The
two loaves I made on Monday were so good, that I made two more on
Tuesday. We've been eating it non-stop: dipped in soup, slathered with jam,
smeared with Brie, etc.
