excerpt: "I made a few changes to the flours, using regular whole wheat instead of soft, and replacing a bit of the AP with kamut flour. One and a half cups of puree is less than one whole can; I was tempted to use all of it, but figured it might make the muffins too dense or gummy. These were a bit disappointing"

These were a bit disappointing as the pumpkin flavour, the millet crunch and the spices just don't appeal to me.
