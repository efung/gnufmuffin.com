excerpt: "My mom gave this book to us as a gift this year, and this is the first item I tried. This recipe, attributed to Tracey Barrett (the daughter-in-law of the author), featured pineapple, nuts and raisins, all things that I like in a carrot cake. To please Dr. S, I made the recommended substitution of chocolate"

This recipe, attributed to Tracey Barrett (the daughter-in-law of the author), featured pineapple, nuts and raisins, all things that I like in a carrot cake. To please Dr. S, I made the recommended substitution of chocolate chips for raisins.  Not a bad quick bread, and a good way to use up about 2 cups of zucchini.
