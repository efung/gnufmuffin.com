excerpt: "I searched for recipes that would use up a carton of leftover buttermilk and found this tasty cake. Extra-large eggs are never in my fridge; I just used 5 large ones. Four organic navel oranges yielded a fragrant amount of zest. I chopped up leftover milk chocolate from my Christmas chocolate making"

One full hour in the oven produced a tall bundt cake that was nicely browned all over. I made the orange glaze but skipped the ganache. This was a deliciously perfumed cake, orange in smell, flavour and colour! I didn't find it too sweet and it was very satisfying, tender with fine crumb. Highly recommended.
