<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/dining/183drex.html?ref=dining">Recipe</a> from <span style="font-style: italic;">Momofuku Milk Bar</span> by Christina Tosi and David Chang <br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Notes</span>: I had the idea to make cornflake crunch earlier this week, and decided that a light panna cotta would be a nice finish for a dinner we were hosting. A few notes: <br /><ul><li>The cornflake crunch comes out very buttery: I had a few puddles of butter on the Silpat. After cooling though, it is surprisingly crunchy.<br /><li>My gelatin sheets must not set as strong as the ones used in the book: The panna cotta was barely set with 3/4 of a sheet.<br /><li>The yield is pretty small. I would make double the amount of panna cotta to serve the same number of people.<br /></ul>I'm experimenting with video these days. Enjoy!  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/IJgvbcJ6udg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
