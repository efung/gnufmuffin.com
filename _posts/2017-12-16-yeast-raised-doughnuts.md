It's the month for deep-frying at our house, to celebrate Hanukkah and the [miracle of the oil](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5069530). Indeed, frying foods in oil _is_ miraculous, transforming
plain food items like broccoli and potatoes into addictive, crispy tempura and French fries.
This year, in addition to crowd-pleasing churros, I also made yeasted doughnuts, with a choice
of two glazes.

There was a lot going on in our house on Saturday, so I didn't get started on making the
dough until 14:00 or so, barely two hours before people were starting to arrive. I used
a [recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/yeast-raised-doughnuts-recipe) from
King Arthur Flour, which made a soft, pillowy dough.

After the first rise, I rolled it thin and cut out smallish circles, letting them rise on
two half-sheet pans. The room I let them rise in was not very warm, so after an hour, they
were still pretty flat. But people were waiting, so I started to deep fry them anyway.
These little smushy discs puffed up right away: some became almost spherical, others into
the familiar donut shape.

Once were sufficiently brown, I drained them on paper towels, putting them outside at 0Â°C to hasten
their cooling. I made two glazes earlier in the day: a dark chocolate ganache ([recipe](https://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/dark-chocolate-ganache-glaze)), and a blueberry glaze ([recipe](https://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/amaretto-cherry-glaze)), both from Saveur. To make the latter from the linked recipe, I substituted
100% blueberry juice for the cherry syrup.

These donuts were just okay. Eaten with minutes of them coming out of the oil, they were
not too bad, sweet and yeasty. Some were dense and bready, while others were fantastically 
hollow, ready to be filled with lemon custard, strawberry jam, or chocolate sauce. I think
getting a good rise after shaping is key. Leftovers were definitely not as good.
