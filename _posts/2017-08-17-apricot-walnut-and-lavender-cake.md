The people at the fruit stand last weekend told me hail damaged a lot of
their apricot crop. Many of the tiny fruit had deep, scarred pockmarks. 
This explained why the baskets were only $5 each. After a few days of letting 
them soften at room temperature, I tasted one and was disappointed with
their blandness. Making a cake that had other strong flavours seemed
like a good way to use up these less-than-perfect specimens.

Plenty More, a cookbook by Yotam Ottolenghi is the source for this 
[recipe](http://ottawacitizen.com/storyline/the-mix-of-walnuts-apricots-and-lavender-in-this-cake-recipe-is-heavenly).
Aside from substituting a vegetable oil for the expensive walnut
oil, and grinding the almonds myself, I stuck to the recipe. Do
try to squeeze as many apricots on the surface as you can, as
they shrink quite a bit during baking.

I love nut cakes, and this one did not disappoint. It's moist
and not too dense, and the tart apricots keep the sweetness in check.
I loved the subtle pine-like fragrance from the fresh lavender
I used. My only criticism would be that the lemon icing on top
didn't appeal to me. I would brush strained apricot jam, or
make a honey syrup or something like that next time.
