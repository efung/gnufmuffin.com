April Bloomfield's <i>A Girl and Her Greens</i> is a vegetable-focused
cookbook, with a few sweet ideas thrown in. To use up a medium-sized
pumpkin we bought, we tried making her pancakes one Saturday morning.
Unfortunately, they weren't really appetizing.

I couldn't find a copy of the recipe online, but it includes polenta,
and a winter squash (I roasted a pumpkin). The vegetable pur√©e is even
blended into maple syrup as a topping for the pancakes.

The pumpkin mash was a bit stringy, as I used a hand masher, and not
a blender to break it down. As a result, the pancakes were a bit
crumbly, and I also found the taste of the polenta to be unpleasant.
I prefer coarse cornmeal in pancakes, which retains its crunch.
