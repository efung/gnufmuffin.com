Real honeycomb, the hexagonal cells made of wax that bees make their honey in,
is soft, chewy, and sweet. That's not what this cookie recipe is referring to,
though. Rather, it's a hard, brittle confection whose cross-section
is nowhere near as regular or beautiful as that produced by our
apian friends.

I had high hopes for this [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020656-peanut-shortbread-with-honeycomb)
from the 2019 NYT Christmas Cookie spectacular. It featured ground and whole peanuts
in the shortbread base, smothered with a sponge toffee made from lightly caramelized
honey. Due to our oven breakdown, I made this dough, and patted it into two 8" square
tins, and let it chill out in the fridge for a few days.

When it came time to make the honeycomb, I made sure to watch the video a few times, as
well as reading through a few of the comments on the NYT cooking site. One repeated
comment was to ensure that you don't heat the syrup over 300â„‰, otherwise the hardened
toffee might not stick to your cookie base. The other tip was to limit stirring or spreading
of the molten, bubbly liquid, to ensure it kept as many bubbles as possible, yielding
the lightest, crumbliest texture.

Unfortunately, I suffered from both problems. Despite keeping a careful eye on the 
temperature and agitation, my honeycomb ended up thin and hard, and didn't stick
to the peanut cookie base when I chiselled the square apart.

From a taste perspective, these were pretty delicious. The honey-peanut
combination is classic and satisfying, and I felt the chocolate
drizzle was something that would detract from these two strong
flavours, so I left it out. I would probably not make this again,
because it makes such a large batch, but I would like the practice
in making sponge toffee.
