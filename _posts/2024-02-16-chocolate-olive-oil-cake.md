After being invited to Friday night dinner, we were asked to make
a dessert that was dairy-free to accommodate an allergy in the host.
Dr. S suggested something vegan, but I landed on this olive oil cake
with a small modification.

The [recipe](https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-week-us/20231208/282170770911094)
comes from Cook's Illustrated Nov/Dec 2023, and is an adaptation of
the author's previous olive oil cake. To make a long story short, you
can't just replace some of the flour with cocoa powder. I made it
totally dairy-free by swapping out the milk and using 1/2 cup of
coconut milk.

On its own, it looks quite plain. But dressed up with berries, it is
quite an elegant end to a meal. My only criticism is the sugar topping:
it's supposed to produce a crunchy surface, but we didn't sprinkle 
very evenly so much of it didn't dissolve and looks out of place.
This cake was moist and rich, and a great dairy-free recipe to have 
in your repertoire.
