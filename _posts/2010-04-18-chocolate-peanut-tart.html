excerpt: "With the last chunks of milk chocolate I had leftover from the big, chocolate making project, I decided to make this dessert ahead of time for a dinner party on Friday. The original uses walnuts, but a sidenote says it works really well with salted peanuts too. On Sunday, I worked on the crust, a chocolate-almond"

The original uses walnuts, but a sidenote says it works really well with salted peanuts too. On Sunday, I worked on the crust, a chocolate-almond pate sablée dough recipe that made enough for three 9" tarts. It was pretty crumbly and buttery, but rolled out nicely into my tart tin. The milk chocolate ganache filling is poured on the bottom in a thin layer, and the nuts are sprinkled on. I extrapolated on this step and let the ganache set for 10 minutes in the freezer, thinking this would help keep the nuts from floating when the rest of the filling was poured on. Freezing the tart for a few days didn't affect it too much, and I let it thaw overnight before serving.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot: for the garnish, I took a small plastic lid and gently placed it on top of the tart before sprinkling peanuts around the outer ring.<br /><br />The tart was pretty good. While the crunch of nuts in every forkful was welcome, I kept wanting there to be more peanut flavour in the ganache.
