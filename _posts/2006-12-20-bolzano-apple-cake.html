Then, download the <a href="http://www.tastingmenu.com/allaboutapples/default.htm">beautiful electronic cookbook</a> from which this recipe is taken. The cake is quite simple and fast to make, provided you have a food processor or mandoline to slice the apples with. Do use a large bowl, so that you can effectively whip the eggs by hand, and stir the apple mixture thoroughly. The recipe in the PDF cookbook is different from the one in the NYT; I used the latter, which gives the weight of apples and incorporates less sugar. Highly recommended.
