Many used way too much honey (&frac12; cup), didn't use enough sweet potato or had a wide variation in flour. As an experienced baker, I should be able to compensate and adjust recipes, but I also want things to turn out the first time, and would rather find a "good" recipe that I can just follow.<br /><br />In the end, I adapted this Martha Stewart recipe for pumpkin challah, omitting all the spices so it wouldn't taste like pie. On Friday morning, I made a half recipe, all in the mixer with a dough hook. I didn't feel like I needed to bust out the paddle to combine some of the ingredients. Less cleanup = happy. 3/8 cup of egg yolks was 5 large eggs for me. The dough was extremely easy to work with, and formed a nice ball completely in the mixer. A minute or two of hand kneading afterwards was sufficient to get to the windowpane stage.<br /><br />After an accelerated proofing in a warmed oven, I weighed out six balls of dough, and Dr. S and I made quick work of forming the ropes for braiding. I used <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22p3wIHLupc">this YouTube video</a> as a refresher on 6-strand braiding. It also demonstrates a neat idea for applying the sesame seeds, by using your finger to tap them on each lobe.<br /><br />The photo doesn't quite capture the beautiful coral colour of the bread's interior. It puffed up beautifully during baking to a nice high loaf. You can't taste any of the sweet potato flavour, but this bread is a nice change from the usual. I'm going to make it again using whole eggs, instead of yolks and see what happens.
