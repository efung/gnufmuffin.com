Her recipe for the poaching liquid includes black peppercorns, coriander seeds, cardamom pods, star anise and bay leaf. It took a long time to set: about an hour and a half. A little too sweet as I used pandoro again and forgot to reduce the sugar. The pears were not as tender as I would have liked but the pudding got many compliments from my tasters.
