While browsing one of my favourite baking supply stores in the city, I came across
their selection of [coloured cocoa butters](https://www.madamegateaux.ca/collections/ingredients-colours/products/roxy-rich-artist-collection-coloured-cocoa-butter-56g) from the Canadian company,
[Roxy & Rich](https://www.roxyandrich.com/). Despite my aversion
to artificial colourings, I couldn't resist picking some up
for a molded chocolate project.

My idea for the shells was inspired by the filling, which was going to be flavoured with 
[five-spice powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-spice_powder), a blend of
several different spices. Since the cocoa butter is solid at room temperature, I had to
scrape out a small quantity from the container into a glass bowl.
I needed so little that I didn't bother to try and temper it, but
simply melted it in the microwave. I then dipped a chopstick into the
liquid cocoa butter, and used it to splatter and "paint" the molds.
Once one colour had set, I applied another.

For the filling, I followed the Five-Spice Praline recipe in 
[Making Artisan Chocolates](/tag/makingartisanchocolates/) 
by Andrew Garrison Shotts. This was my first time making a praline, where
I ran the food processor long enough (almost 6 or 7 minutes), 
for the mixture to become a pasty liquid.

I hate recipes that call for a "pinch" of something, a very 
subjective measurement. I decided
to be bold and used a full half teaspoon of five-spice
powder, one that I had ground myself some time ago. This notably
flavoured the ganache, and was not subtle at all. I was immediately
reminded of Chinese roast duck.

I think this was one of my best [handmade chocolates](/tag/chocolate-making/) ever.
The shells turned out beautifully, and I got to try a technique I've never
done before. The filling had two kinds of crunch from the praline
and feuilletine, and the unexpected flavours of hazelnut and five-spice powder,
which yielded a savoury quality to these chocolates.

With the leftover ganache, I made small truffle balls, dipped them
in tempered, melted chocolate, then rolled them in crushed feuilletine. Yum!
