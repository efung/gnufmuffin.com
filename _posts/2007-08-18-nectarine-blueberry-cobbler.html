excerpt: "A very easy recipe to make, start to finish in under an hour. The biscuits contain no butter, with the only fat coming from the cream.

The biscuits contain no butter, with the only fat coming from the cream. The dough was a bit dry, so I kneaded it a few times to distribute the moisture. Surprisingly, the biscuits were quite flaky and tender, but very bland as there isn't much sugar. They're a good match for the juicy fruit.
