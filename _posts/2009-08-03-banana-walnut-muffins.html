I like this magazine a lot and have always felt that subscribers should get access to it for free, so I grumbled about having to pay. But it's a couple of bucks a month and even though it's only been a week, I love it!<br /><br />These muffins call for creaming the butter and sugar (like a cake) so it's a little more work. But what was of most interest to me was the use of diced, rather than mashed, bananas. The little pieces provide little bursts of banana flavour with each bite of the muffin. With 3 cups of flour, this recipe makes 12 giant and satisfying breakfast treats.<br /><br />If you are a subscriber to the site, you can get the recipe <a href="http://cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=5709">here</a>. Otherwise, note that the link to the recipe above has a typo: the correct quantity of yogurt is 1&frac12; cups.
