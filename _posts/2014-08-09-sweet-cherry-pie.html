Cook's Illustrated published a pie recipe using sweet&nbsp;cherries a few years ago that I've always wanted to try, so this week, I bought a 3L basket of the season's last harvest and got to work.</p><a name='more'></a><br /><p>The farmer from <a href="http://www.farmersmarketsontario.com/mypick/profiles.cfm?uFarmerID=176">Sun-Ray Orchards</a> (where I bought the cherries) told me that Bing cherries aren't widely planted in Ontario, and that the basket I bought were of the Hedelfingen cultivar. (<a href="http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/02-037.pdf">Here</a> is a detailed factsheet about cherry agriculture in Ontario. Did you know sweet and tart cherries can't pollinate each other? Or that farmers put beehives in their orchards?)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.annies-eats.com/2010/07/02/sweet-cherry-pie/">recipe</a> uses the now-standard vodka pie crust, so I made that first, and put the discs in the fridge. Next, I began the laborious process of washing, stemming and pitting 6 cups of cherries. Fortunately, we have a <a href="http://www.oxo.com/p-466-cherry-olive-pitter.aspx">pitter</a> that we had the foresight (or silliness) to include on our wedding registry. I missed the part about halving the cherries: don't skip this, as the cherries really don't break down much during baking. Pur√©eing some of the fruit with plums helps to balance out the sweetness as well as adding some liquid. And instead of pulverizing minute tapioca, I just used two scant tablespoons of tapioca flour. Because we're the kind of household that keeps tapioca flour around.</p><p>Once the filling was made, I poured it into the chilled dough bottom, and was very close to overflowing the crust. To be safe, I removed about a half cup of extra liquid, before sealing the pie with the top crust. I baked the pie for the minimum time, and not surprisingly, the dough on the bottom was a little raw.</p><p>I liked the flavour of this pie: sweet with a little tartness. The texture of the fruit was a bit firm, but I think that's highly dependent on the particular cherry you're using, as well as how small you cut the pieces. It's an interesting change from a sour cherry pie, but I think both have their merits.</p>
