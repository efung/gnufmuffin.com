Continuing through the NYT 2019 Holiday Cookie Extravaganza, the next cookie
I planned for our housewarming were these two-tone sesame cookies. The hardest
part of the process? Sourcing the ingredients.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020650-marbled-tahini-cookies)
calls for two dark ingredients: black sanding sugar, and black tahini. My first
stop was [Bulk Barn](https://www.bulkbarn.ca/home-en/), but two locations I 
checked had every colour of decorative sugar except **black**, and no black
tahini either. [Fresh & Wild](https://freshandwild.ca/) and [Loblaws](https://www.loblaws.ca/)
were also no help. Ultimately, I found not one, but _two_ options for
black tahini at [Nations Experience](http://nationsfreshfoods.ca/). But,
I struck out on the black sugar.

Making the dough was simple enough, as it's a basic sugar cookie, to which two 
varieties of tahini are added. The resulting doughs are layered and gently kneaded
to yield a marble-like pattern in cross-section. I'm not sure why the instructions
say to coat the loaf pan with cooking spray, then line with plastic wrap. I didn't
grease my pan, but my guess is it's to help the plastic wrap cling to the metal pan.

I loved the strong sesame flavour of this cookie. The thin and crisp slices were
generously sized, but not too filling. I would try experimenting with the marbling effect 
([pixel cookies](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-Pixel-Cookies/) anyone?) next
time. Highly recommended.
