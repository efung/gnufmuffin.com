This may happen due to shopping list duplication between Flick and I, or a Costco-triggered impulse buy. Our neighbours went on vacation and gifted us with the perishable contents of their fridge. Since last week, I have tried to get through 2.5kg of plain yogurt, making four loaves of <a href="http://gnufmuffin.blogspot.ca/2008/03/banana-cake.html">banana cake</a>, a dozen large <a href="http://gnufmuffin.blogspot.ca/2014/07/lemon-blueberry-muffins-cooks.html">muffins</a>, and a batch of <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/05/muesli-cereal-breakfast-recipe.html">muesli</a>. In addition, I baked two loaves of no-knead whole wheat bread, and a blueberry pie. To cap off this flurry of activity, I made this yogurt pudding.</p><a name='more'></a><p>A search on my <a href="http://www.eatyourbooks.com/">Eat Your Books</a> library led to this <a href="http://www.sharelovenotsecrets.com/yoghurt-pudding-with-poached-pears/">recipe</a> for a yogurt pudding with poached peaches. It's a panna cotta made from a mixture of various dairy ingredients, lightly sweetened, flavoured with vanilla and citrus (I used lemon zest). For the fruit, I used two large, white peaches that were unfortunately quite mealy. Since neither of us enjoy licorice-flavoured liqueurs like arak or ouzo, I substituted some <a href="http://karloestates.com/buy-wine/#vanalstinewhite">white port</a> from Prince Edward County.</p><p>This is a very satisfying dessert. The rich pudding is a nice foil for the slightly tart fruit, and the roasted nuts provide a contrasting crunch. As other bloggers have tried, I think other tart fruit would make a good variation, like sour cherries or plums.</p>
