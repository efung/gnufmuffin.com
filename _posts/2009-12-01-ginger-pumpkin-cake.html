When I saw the awesomeness of the ginger pumpkin cake, I knew I had to try it. The first step is creating the dehydrated flavour sheet (Fruit Roll-Up, that is). I used fresh roasted pumpkin, pureed and then spread onto a Silpat fitted into a half sheet pan (18&times;13"). I dried the mixture for about 6 hours at 180&deg;F, the lowest my oven could go. As for the cake, a slightly heaped &frac12; tsp of baking powder (or soda) is equivalent to the called-for 2.5 g. To achieve the layered effect, I used a small offset spatula to spread a few tablespoons of batter in the pan, then cut the flavour sheet to fit in the loaf pan. I repeated this until I used up the flavour sheet and batter. This cake was <b>outstanding</b>. The pumpkin layers look incredible and are distinct, both in taste and texture, from the gingery cake. I'm imagining all sorts of other contrasts, perhaps a cranberry flavour sheet with a walnut pound cake. Or maybe piping batter into a flavour sheet tube and putting that in the middle of the loaf to get a circle effect in the sliced cake.
