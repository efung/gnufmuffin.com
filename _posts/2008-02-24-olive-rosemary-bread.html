excerpt: "Like every good CI recipe, this one had plenty of explanation for each of the steps so it\'s easy to follow. I used a mix of pimento-stuffed Manzanilla and oil-cured black olives. The only part I was uncertain about was after dividing, and rounding up the dough, whether to pat it down before rolling"

I used a mix of pimento-stuffed Manzanilla and oil-cured black olives. The only part I was uncertain about was after dividing, and rounding up the dough, whether to pat it down before rolling into an oval. I did but really shouldn't have, as the baked loaves didn't have that big, open crumb structure. Also, I was lazy with the water spray so my crust wasn't as crisp as it could have been. The bread is a bit chewy, but oh is it ever salty! The black olives I used just have way too much salt. Overall, it's a very tasty bread, soft, tender, with a nice rosemary background and packed full of olives.
