excerpt: "I used some very juicy Flemish Beauty pears for this. It took almost a half hour for all the liquid to evaporate, but once it does, watch the pan carefully as the fruit scorches easily. The large amount of pear liqueur gives it quite a kick. At first, I couldn't really taste the pear, but after ripening"

It took almost a half hour for all the liquid to evaporate, but once it does, watch the pan carefully as the fruit scorches easily. The large amount of pear liqueur gives it quite a kick. At first, I couldn't really taste the pear, but after ripening overnight in the freezer, it became more evident. This recipe made more than my ice cream maker could handle, about two quarts in total. I like this technique of concentrating the pear flavour by boiling down the pears, but a more perfumed variety would make it even more flavourful. Or else, just stick with <a href="http://gnuf.blogsite.org/2005/10/pear-sorbet.html">sorbet</a>.
