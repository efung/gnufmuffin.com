Disappointed by the [loaf](/2014/10/multigrain-boule.html) from
last week, I looked for another multigrain bread and found one I've
never blogged about from Peter Reinhart's classic book.

I feel I've made this bread before, but can't find an entry about
it in my blog. The
[recipe](http://www.themanlyhousekeeper.com/2011/10/04/bread-baker-multi-grain-bread-extraordinaire/)'s
ingredient list isn't that long, but does
include 3 tbsp of cooked brown rice, not something
I had on hand. But everything else was found in my pantry: oatmeal,
cornmeal, bran, and AP flour.

The bread starts with a grain soaker, which I let sit for 24 hours.
After the dough was kneaded in the mixer, I let it proof at room
temperature for 90 minutes, then shaped the dough into a <i>boule</i>.
I used a <i>banneton</i> lined with brown rice flour and left it in the
fridge for the final proof, as we had company over.

When it had risen well above the lip of the proofing basket, I baked it
in the oven, on a baking sheet placed directly on a baking stone that was
preheated on the floor of the oven. I needed a few extra minutes of
baking time, before reaching the target internal temperature.

This bread was great. Good, open crumb, and a fairly light texture.
It doesn't taste “healthy” but it's not a 100% wholegrain loaf. Personally, 
I want a bread to be tasty as well as good for you, but I'm not quite 
ready to completely give up white flour. I feel a blend of flours
is a good compromise. That said, this bread doesn't use whole wheat
flour at all, but does have some wheat bran in it.
