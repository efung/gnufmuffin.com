Continuing with our epic December baking project, my daughter and I made
a chocolatey, gingery cookie next. This one was definitely like a 
circular brownie in that it was chewy, moist, and full of chocolate
flavour, but it lacked a strong ginger kick.

The [recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020655-gingery-brownie-crinkle-cookies)
is from the New York Times, by Susan Spungen. I let the melted chocolate and butter
cool for quite a while, while I made the rest of the batter. Once it was all combined
together, I didn't actually find the batter to be too runny (contrary to what the recipe
cautions). However, due to time constraints, I put the dough into the fridge.

An hour or two later, I was ready to bake, but the dough had predictably hardened too much.
I used a portion scoop of just under an ounce, or about two tablespoons. Even though
it was cold, the scoops spread quite a bit in the hot oven.

Fresh out of the oven, these warm, gooey cookies were delicious. Even after a week or so,
they stayed quite chewy and moist. Like other reviewers on the NYT website, I found that the ginger
flavour was quite lacking in the cookie itself, so I was glad for the slivers of candied ginger
on top. The chocolate chips distracted from the ginger flavour too, so I'd omit them next time.
