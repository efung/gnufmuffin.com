Since I don't like to repeat baking projects, I decided to make a chai variation after seeing a chai cupcake recipe in a magazine. I replaced the molasses in the original recipe with buckwheat honey, and replaced the spices with an equivalent amount of a finely ground chai tea blend. For the filling, I followed Candy's Italian meringue buttercream recipe, adding a chai spice blend to the hot syrup, and adding more cardamom, cinnamon and ginger to the whipped buttercream. The macarons are too big and I undercooked them slightly so they're a little chewy in the middle. Or maybe I overcooked them because they are very crunchy and cause the filling to ooze out when you bite into them. Not enough chai flavour also, so more quantities of spices are needed.
