I bookmarked this NY Times article last fall since I don't know much about this grain, and have never tried baking with it. There's a bit of prep work: I used a small Braun coffee grinder (which I use as a spice mill) to make the quinoa flour. A food processor was not very effective at pulverizing the grains. I also cooked a batch of quinoa and let it cool.<br /><br />The best part about these muffins (for my wife anyway) was that they were not too sweet. They taste like healthy muffins, due to the texture of the cooked quinoa, but for a 100% whole-grain muffin, they are good. I've already been asked to make them again, maybe with the addition of some dried fruit.
