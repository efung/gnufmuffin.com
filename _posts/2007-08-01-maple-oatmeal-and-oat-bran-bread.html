excerpt: "The linked recipe directions are quite different than what the book describes. For the flours, I used whole wheat durum flour, and a mix of bread flour and AP flour. My KitchenAid did all the kneading work (at 3rd speed). I did the first rise overnight in the fridge after which it more than doubled;"

For the flours, I used whole wheat durum flour, and a mix of bread flour and AP flour. My KitchenAid did all the kneading work (at 3rd speed). I did the first rise overnight in the fridge after which it more than doubled; 2 tbsp of active dry yeast is used in this bread, quite a lot, but it doesn't taste yeasty. It rose tremendously in the oven into a nice shaped loaf. The flavour is excellent, a good balance of wheat and oats, and a light sweetness from the syrup. Would make this again.
