It wasn't completed in time, but I made this chocolate-pear tart anyhow. The pate sucree crust was partially baked, before being filled with finely chopped chocolate, sliced Forelle pears and a custard. Make sure you bake this on a sheet pan as my custard-chocolate mixture leaked and burned. My pears weren't ripe enough, and stayed quite firm and flavourless. While everyone proclaimed it to be tasty, I found it to be lacklustre and unattractive. The back cover of my edition says something about how the success of a dessert depends on the quality of the ingredients used. Had I used riper pears, I think that would have transformed this dessert from being mediocre to being a winner.
