I was delighted to find a [fruitcake](/tag/fruitcake) recipe in my newest
cookbook. It's something I actually enjoy eating, and it's one of those
cakes that has as many variations as there are bakers. This version
follows the current trend of eschewing artificially coloured fruit
(green cherries!) in favour of natural ingredients, and makes
a pretty good Christmas cake.

Ottolenghi and Goh (the book authors) discuss their fruitcake 
[here](https://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/blog/yotam-discusses-ottolenghi-christmas-cake/).
There are a few things in the ingredients I want to highlight: _quatre épices_,
a blend of white peppercorn, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger; orange marmalade without
the peel, which, of course, I ignored, as I love the bitter zest; and no nuts,
which I ignored also, since pecans are the best part.

The [recipe](
http://bellyovermind.com/2017/12/14/my-top-10-cookbooks-of-2017-a-new-recipe-for-a-traditional-fruit-cake/cookbook-print/1923/) has two parts: soaking the alcohol and dried fruit, and the actual
creation of the batter and baking it. For the fruit mixture, I subbed in
my brandied cherries for the glacé ones, and poured in some of the syrup
also. I didn't think there was quite enough brandy and rum so I was generous
with the quantities.

I used an 8" round cake pan (3" high) to bake this. It was fully baked
at the minimum time, and didn't brown too much on the surface. The recipe
suggests a marzipan icing, which I personally don't think is needed, but
I do like the idea and look of the torched topping in the book. Maybe
next time. Sliced thinly, and enjoyed with a mug of hot tea, this is a
Christmas cake that is familiar and satisfying.
