I ran out of milk so I used some skim milk powder and water as well. The eggs I used were some sort of Omega-3 Pro (!) ones that had deep orange yolks. This contributed a beautiful warm colour to the bread. I did the first rise at room temperature, then the second rise in the fridge overnight. The active dry yeast was a fresh jar, so it puffed very dramatically both times. Before the final proofing, I shaped the challah using a standard 3-strand braid, then egg-washed twice before it went into the oven. A great tip from this recipe is brushing the exposed parts of the bread with eggwash halfway through baking. This ensures that the entire challah is deeply browned and shiny. The bread was wonderfully tender, with a deep rich flavour thanks to butter and eggs. A fantastic <i>milchig</i> recipe that I highly recommend.
