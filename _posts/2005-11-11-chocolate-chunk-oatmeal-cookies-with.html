excerpt: "This version used quick oats, walnuts, some nice moist dried cranberries and white and bittersweet chocolate (the original calls for old-fashioned oats, all dark chocolate, pecans and dried cherries). You really have to go against your intuition and take these out of the oven when they look underdone,"

You really have to go against your intuition and take these out of the oven when they look underdone, otherwise they won't be soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. The darker sheet pan I used produced flatter, browner cookies; the ones baked on the lighter pan were thicker. Make sure your sheet is big enough: these are huge and spread in the oven. Smells like butterscotch during baking. A substantial, scrumptious and satisfying cookie.
