After eating breakfast at [The Scone
Witch](http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-scone-witch-ottawa-3) in Ottawa
recently, I came back to Toronto wanting to bake my own scones. Fortunately,
the Bouchon book offered an irresistible recipe.

Irresistible, that is, to my 3-year old son who loves anything
chocolate. Like the muffins in [Bouchon Bakery](/tag/Bouchon%20Bakery),
the
[recipe](http://sweetsundaymornings.com/post/42746231207/chocolate-cherry-scones)
for these scones requires some advance planning.  In this case, the
first step is to macerate the cherries in syrup and Kirsch.  Once
the batter is made, it needs to be rested in the fridge, and the
shaped scones need to be frozen overnight.

The batter was very crumbly, and I was suspicious of “pulsing” the
butter with the paddle to get it incorporated into the flour. Normally,
you cut it in with a pastry blender. While scooping the chilled dough
into balls, I had a hard time keeping the chunks together.

Despite the difficulty in shaping them, the baked scones turned out
deliciously. They were crumbly, but not dry, and every bite had at
least a morsel of chocolate and dried cherry. This is another one
of those breakfast-for-dessert items that I highly recommend.
