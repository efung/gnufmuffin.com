Now, I briefly considered ordering one from the T&amp;T bakery, but after a recent disappointment with their so-called &ldquo;chocolate&rdquo; slab cake, I decided to look for other recipes. The one I made <a href="/2006/10/chestnut-cream-cake-with-poached-pears.html">a few years ago</a> might have been a starting point, but somehow I came across this Swiss roll recipe and thought, Why not? A double batch of the sponge was a snap to make with a powerful stand mixer. My only concern was whether I could peel it off the parchment in one piece. I bought two cans of chestnut puree from <a href="http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/shopping/vendors/livelylife.html">Lively Life</a>, one unsweetened, and one sweetened. After tasting the filling, I decided to add some of the unsweetened chestnut puree (maybe a half cup in total) to really boost the chestnut flavour. It gave texture as well, because the unsweetened puree is more solid and doesn't blend in as readily. A double batch of filling was <i>way</i> too much for both rolls, so I would scale the filling by two-thirds next time. I quite liked this rolled cake (as did all the guests) as it combined a tender cake with a delicious chestnut cream filling. The cocoa flavour is a little too prominent, so I would scale it back next time but not completely omit it, as it provides the right colour to go with a chestnut filling.
