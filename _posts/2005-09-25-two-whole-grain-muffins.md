**Barley muffins**: Recipe from [Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Caf√©](http://www.molliekatzen.com/sunlight.php). Notes: The cashews and sesame produce an incredible peanut-like aroma during baking. The texture is chewy and dense, might be good toasted.

**Cornmeal muffins**: [Recipe](http://www.cityline.ca/2010/12/08/orange-dried-cranberry-and-cornmeal-muffins-with-millet/) from _In The Sweet Kitchen_ by Regan Daley. Notes: Another recipe with great contrasts: sweet orange vs. tart cranberry, crunchy millet vs. chewy cornmeal.
