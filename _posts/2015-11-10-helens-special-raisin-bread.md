I've started to go through [Homebaking](/tag/homebaking/) again, and
found this raisin bread which made my son very happy. He and I share
a love of raisins, unlike my wife, who prefers chocolate chips over
pretty much everything else.

The
[recipe](https://teamdinner.wordpress.com/2008/01/23/helens-special-raisin-bread/)
yields two small loaves, but I halved it to make one.
Step one is to scald some milk, which Ochef [tells us](http://www.ochef.com/586.htm)
helps bread to rise better or something like that. I did it in the
microwave.

The rest of the dough ingredients are a pretty standard enriched
formula, with an egg, butter and sugar. Because of the small amount
of yeast, it takes a long time for it to rise, more than twice
as long, actually. I work from home these days, since my Achilles
injury, so I'm able to start a long project like this in the morning,
and have it done before dinner.

I was really surprised by how much the dough rose in the oven! The loaf
absorbed all the brushed-on melted butter by the next morning, and
the outside surface was soft. Inside, the loaf had a nice crumb, but
I might have over-developed the gluten, as it was too chewy. Also,
and most crucially, ½ cup is nowhere near enough raisins for even
a small loaf like this one.
