The New York Times cooking sections are full of useful information, and
it's where I found the dessert recipe for the first night of Passover.
This chocolate pecan cake was super easy to make, and was a nice finish 
to a big dinner.

As a flourless cake, this
[recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013958-nana-joses-chocolate-pecan-cake) 
could not have been any easier to make. Melt butter and chocolate (we
used a microwave), dump the other ingredients in a food processor, then
combine everything together, and pour into a prepared pan.

At the minimum baking time, the cake rose dramatically in the centre,
but as expected, fell immediately after coming out of the oven. We
weren't able to find <i>piloncillo</i> sugar at the local Publix, so we
skipped it, and made the garnish using blueberries, strawberries and key
limes.

For such a simple dessert, this was a winner. The chocolate flavour is
pronounced (we used Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Baking Bar), with
surprisingly little flavour from the pecans. Garnishing each slice with
a bit of whipped cream and fruit provided a nice contrast, and made the
dessert look nice on the plate. Highly recommended, for Pesach, or any
other time.
