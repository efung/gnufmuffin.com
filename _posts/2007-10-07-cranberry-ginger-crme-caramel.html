excerpt: "I followed the master recipe but made a few changes, adding ground ginger to the custard and using maple sugar instead of white. I put a tiny bit of candied ginger puree on the caramel, and added some chopped dried cranberries that I had soaked in a mixture of 100% cranberry juice and maple sugar. In"

I put a tiny bit of candied ginger puree on the caramel, and added some chopped dried cranberries that I had soaked in a mixture of 100% cranberry juice and maple sugar. In the end, this didn't turn out that well. The caramel hardened on the bottom of the ramekins even though I used corn syrup which the author says helps prevent that; I overheated the caramel mixture as it was hard to see the colour beneath all the foaming. The ginger flavour was subtle and the cranberries made for an unusual texture. Oh, it wasn't very rich either, as I only found out afterwards that &ldquo;light cream&rdquo; refers to 18%, not 10% which I used.
