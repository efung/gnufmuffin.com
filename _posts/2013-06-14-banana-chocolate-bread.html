This recipe featured grated chocolate, which sounded interesting to me, and it didn't disappoint. Pulverizing the chocolate in the food processor meant a lot of tiny flakes that clung to everything due to the buildup of static electricity. But it was far easier than chopping it by hand. I really like the combination of bananas, chocolate and walnuts in this cake. I'd make this again.
