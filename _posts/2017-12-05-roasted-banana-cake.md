Ground coffee was what attracted me to this recipe, along with a topping of chocolate 
chunks and walnuts. This embellished banana cake is well worth the effort, and I 
would highly recommend making it.

The [recipe](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/recipes/recipe-roasted-banana-cake/article36846190/)
is from Tara O'Brady. In a technique that I've not come across before, you roast the bananas
_whole_ in their skins.

When you split the cooled bananas open, do it over a bowl, as there's a surprising amount 
of liquid inside. As for the batter of this cake, the ingredient list is a bit longer than
most cakes, as it includes sour cream, rolled oats, whole wheat flour, and ground coffee,
in addition to regular cake components. But hang in there, it's well worth the effort.

For the topping, I used 72% dark chocolate pastilles, and omitted the raw sugar. 70 minutes
in the oven, as suggested in the recipe, was how long it took for my cake to be fully baked.

I really, _really_ liked this cake. It has so many interesting flavours going on, but at its
heart, is still a banana cake. With its use of two whole grains, I can almost convince myself
that it's a healthy dessert.
