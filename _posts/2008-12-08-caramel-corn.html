We found a hot-air popper at Tap Phong in Chinatown, got the kernel corn in Kensington Market and went home to embark on our little project. We followed the recipe but omitted the molasses. One cup of kernels (two batches with our popper) was enough for this recipe. On one batch, we tried substituting maple syrup with disastrous results. The sugary mixture never melted properly and stayed in granular chunks. I didn't have the use of a thermometer but the ice water check was good enough. You do have to work quickly in order to get the caramel mixture combined evenly with the popcorn. A delicious snack, but a bit of work.
