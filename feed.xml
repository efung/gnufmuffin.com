making things like curds, ice creams, custards, etc. Financiers
are one way to use them up, but haven’t been a regular in our household.
However, with the success of this batch, I may now have a go-to recipe
whenever we have a surplus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://duchessbakeshop.com/blogs/the-duchess-blog/a-mothers-day-treat-with-recipe&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; is from the &lt;em&gt;Duchess Bake Shop&lt;/em&gt; cookbook.
This is not a beginner’s book: it caters towards experienced bakers,
with measurements in weights and volumes, and a few complicated creations
with multiple sub-recipes like the 
&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/04/tart-montreal-step-by-step.html&quot;&gt;Tart Montréal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53578241594/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Raspberry Pistachio Financiers&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53578241594_2942cb6959_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pistachio Financiers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this financier is one of the easier recipes. Even if you don’t have
the traditional shaped pan, you could use mini-muffin pans. I
have a pair of silicone molds, each with 7 large cavities, and I
can’t recall that I’ve ever used them before!  With sky-high grocery
prices, I opted for blackberries on sale at the supermarket as a
substitute, but found reasonably priced raspberries the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53578134093/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Raspberry Pistachio Financiers&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53578134093_44210afac2_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pistachio Financiers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These turned out great, and taste &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; when they’re still warm. The
fruit makes them get moist and sticky in the next few days, so I’d
warm them in a toaster oven before serving. I also had some problems popping
them out even though I buttered and floured the mold. Definitely be
generous with the sprinkling of nuts. Next time, I’d use smaller pieces of
fruits to ensure they don’t contribute too much moisture.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Fung</name></author><category term="eggwhites" /><category term="almond" /><category term="pistachio" /><category term="raspberry" /><category term="financier" /><summary type="html">Using up egg whites is a recurring issue when making things like curds, ice creams, custards, etc. Financiers are one way to use them up, but haven’t been a regular in our household.

comes from Cook’s Illustrated Nov/Dec 2023, and is an adaptation of
the author’s previous olive oil cake. To make a long story short, you
can’t just replace some of the flour with cocoa powder. I made it
totally dairy-free by swapping out the milk and using 1/2 cup of
coconut milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its own, it looks quite plain. But dressed up with berries, it is
quite an elegant end to a meal. My only criticism is the sugar topping:
it’s supposed to produce a crunchy surface, but we didn’t sprinkle 
very evenly so much of it didn’t dissolve and looks out of place.

any sane person would do and made condensed milk: two batches, in fact.
Read on to see how we used 8 litres of milk in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key lime pie is a wonderful sweet-tart dessert associated with those
tiny, hard-to-squeeze citrus fruits. But I prefer using regular limes,
as they’re so much easier to juice. And, according to Stella Parks, 
Florida might not have any claim to the dessert anyway. I used the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2017/10/02/magic-key-lime-pie&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;
from her cookbook, which calls for making your own condensed milk and
graham crackers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53577408669/in/dateposted/&quot; title=&quot;Graham Crackers&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53577408669_d1b2e8f456_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Graham Crackers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2017/10/02/crispy-whole-wheat-graham-crackers&quot;&gt;crackers&lt;/a&gt; 
are made with 100% whole wheat flour, sweetened with honey,
and gently spiced with cinnamon. There’s quite a bit of baking soda to
keep them crisp. Do keep an eye them, as I think 20 minutes at 350°F
is too long. My batches got very dark at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2017/10/04/quick-condensed-milk&quot;&gt;quick condensed milk&lt;/a&gt; was simple but requires constant stirring. 
Stella’s trick is to use heavy cream to prevent burning. It was 
delicious, as expected, and did not have that strong dairy flavour that 
the canned stuff often has. We also made a batch of the chai spiced 
version that my daughter and I enjoyed for a week, to make an easy chai
latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53577082646/in/dateposted/&quot; title=&quot;Magic Key Lime Pie&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53577082646_bea3897266_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Magic Key Lime Pie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the pie: aside from making the condensed milk yourself, 
the custard is like any other key lime pie. We didn’t have four hours
to chill it, so the first evening we served the pie, the slices were a bit 
runny. But the leftovers didn’t last long. I thought the flavour was 
delicious, but wanted more filling and less crust. Maybe I’ll use a 
slightly smaller dish next time, or make the crust a tad thinner.
This is a very impressive dessert to make, if you like scratch baking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Fung</name></author><category term="pie" /><category term="lime" /><summary type="html">Faced with a lot of milk at its best before date, I did what any sane person would do and made condensed milk: two batches, in fact.

of before.  Wikipedia
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Grey%27s_Chutney&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it
usually has raisins, but none of the ones I found included it.  To
avoid over-stocking on this condiment, I stopped shopping at three
jars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recipe is from &lt;em&gt;Fabulous Modern Cookies&lt;/em&gt; and I’ve had my eye on 
it since I got the book. Curry powder is used in the dough, and it’s
rolled in finely chopped cashews, how good does that sound? I quickly
weighed each portion (12 grams!) to ensure the cookies were evenly sized.
The gently curved end of a bamboo spatula was the perfect tool to re-form
the thumbprints after the cookies were partially baked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what chutney did I use? I opened a jar of Brooklyn Delhi’s Mango
Chutney Major Grey’s Style, and rejected it for being too runny.
Next, was Patak’s: they sell &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pataks.ca/categories-products/chutneys-pickles&quot;&gt;chutneys&lt;/a&gt; but Fiesta Farms did not have the Major
Grey one, so I settled for their sweet version. It was thicker, and had
bits of fruit in it. Lastly, the Sharwoods jar will have to wait
for a different project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53447173908/in/dateposted/&quot; title=&quot;Mango Chutney Thumbprints&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53447173908_a8710e9354_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Mango Chutney Thumbprints&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recipe makes a lot of cookies, something like four dozen. Each 
are two bites, and the flavour is complex and very satisfying. Even
Dr. S, who recoils whenever I stray too far in the savoury direction,
gave them a nod.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Fung</name></author><category term="cashew" /><category term="cookies" /><category term="Holiday 2023" /><summary type="html">This cookie called for “Major Grey” chutney, which I had never heard of before.

Mmm, sounds good to me.
Unfortunately, these turned out sub-optimally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recipe is from &lt;em&gt;Fabulous Modern Cookies&lt;/em&gt; and calls for rice flour
and smoked almonds (I used a tin from Blue Diamond). The dough
is very crumbly, but the fun part is just patting it all into a 
sheet pan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53447359269/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Smoked Almond and Caramel Cookie Crunch&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53447359269_d2f2921411_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Smoked Almond and Caramel Cookie Crunch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where I think there’s a problem with the recipe or a problem
with my oven: it says to bake it at 350°F on a low rack for 
27 to 35 minutes. At minimum time, it was quite dark at the edges
and the butterscotch chips looked more like chocolate chips! I would 
start checking at the 15 minute mark next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that the whole slab held together as I inverted it.
As expected, it was overcooked, and ended up being hard, rather than
crunchy.

portrait. The blend of almond and pistachio in a pleasing swirl was
the hands-down winner for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021709-pistachio-pinwheels&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;
is in the NYT, but is adapted from Claire Saffitz’ &lt;em&gt;Dessert Person&lt;/em&gt;.
It’s a rich, buttery dough, with the addition of ground nuts. While
watching something on TV, I shelled the unsalted pistachios, then tried
to remove as much of the skins as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that you can do the whole thing in the food processor. After blitzing
everything together, two thirds of the dough gets mixed with almond flour, 
and the remainders gets blitzed some more with the pulverized pistachios. 
After rolling and chilling the almond layer, you spread on the still-soft 
pistachio dough, and roll the whole thing up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53446117457/in/dateposted/&quot; title=&quot;Pistachio Pinwheels&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53446117457_f2fd4d5302_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Pistachio Pinwheels&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was busy with another cookie, so forgot to visually check these at
the minimum bake time. Oops, they browned too much, so I think I lost
the colour contrast. Or maybe it’s because I didn’t peel enough of the
skins, or maybe I should blanch the nuts first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taste is what really matters though. They’re really crumbly,
extremely nutty and delicious. Highly recommend, and I will definitely 
repeat this one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Fung</name></author><category term="cookies" /><category term="pistachio" /><category term="Holiday 2023" /><summary type="html">This cookie got consumed so fast, I didn’t get a chance to take its portrait.

quite satisfying to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020538-peanut-butter-miso-cookies&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;
is an older New York Times one. I forgot, but this isn’t the first time I’ve made
a cookie with this combination: a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnufmuffin.com/2011/01/peanut-butter-miso-cookies.html&quot;&gt;previous experiment&lt;/a&gt; 
was done all the way back in 2011. Anyway, for this recipe, I used a natural 
chunky peanut butter, organic white (shiro) miso, and skipped rolling the huge balls
of dough in Demerara sugar (as I don’t have any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53447455770/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Peanut Butter-Miso Cookies&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53447455770_d71b9b8dc5_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Peanut Butter-Miso Cookies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked doing the pan-banging technique on these huge cookies. They were still
quite chewy hours later. Some of our friends loved these. To me, they were
too mellow and blended the individual flavours too much. Maybe I would
like a miso cookie that was topped with chopped peanuts?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Fung</name></author><category term="cookies" /><category term="peanut butter" /><category term="miso" /><category term="Holiday 2023" /><summary type="html">On to the third cookie of our holiday baking: this one, a mix of peanut butter and miso.

labour. Three different doughs, lots of measuring and cutting
and assembling, and slicing. But, it made for a fabulous
presentation and the flavours are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024781-neapolitan-checkerboard-cookies&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; is from this year’s NYT Cookie Week. It’s meant
to evoke &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_ice_cream&quot;&gt;Neapolitan ice cream&lt;/a&gt; 
in its flavouring: vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53447455795/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Neapolitan Checkerboard Cookies&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53447455795_fd88e78778_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;Neapolitan Checkerboard Cookies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one special ingredient you need is freeze dried strawberries.
Most of the time, we buy the snack packets from our local Dollarama.
You make the doughs in a particular
order, so you don’t need to wash your mixing bowl between doughs.
Do pay attention to the quantities needed in each recipe. I reduced
the sugar slightly in my strawberry dough, because mine were 
sweetened already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped buying plastic wrap (clingfilm, Sarah Wrap, etc.) so I
wrapped my doughs in leftover produce and bread bags that we save.
Once they were cold enough, I had my daughter get out a ruler and
rolling pin, and start to make the strips. Getting an even 
rectangle was probably the hardest part. After that, slicing the
plank into nine, half-inch strips was easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/53447359164/in/dateposted/&quot; title=&quot;Neapolitan Checkerboard Cookies&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53447359164_44204834cb_c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; alt=&quot;Neapolitan Checkerboard Cookies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assembly was a lot of fun, as was smushing all of them together
to form the pattern. Due to time constraints, the logs only chilled
for about 6 hours, but we baked off two logs anyway so we could 
bring them to a party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on the vanilla parts of the cookies, they’ll tell you when
they’re baked enough. If you leave them in the oven too long, they’ll
brown too much and then you’ll lose the colour contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved that these were so pretty to look at, and that you could
taste each flavour in those little tiny squares.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Fung</name></author><category term="chocolate" /><category term="vanilla" /><category term="strawberry" /><category term="cookies" /><category term="Holiday 2023" /><summary type="html">This cookie is a real labour of love, with emphasis on the labour.
