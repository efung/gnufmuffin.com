  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>Sponge</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Line one baking sheet with parchment paper. 
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whip the eggs, sugar and vanilla for 10-12 minutes on 3rd speed. Mix to a foamy thick texture.
    <li>Sift the flour and fold in by hand. 
    <li>Spread the batter on the baking tray with an offset palette knife.
    <li>Bake at 375&deg;F for 12-15 minutes until light golden.
  </ol>
  <h3>Mousse</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the gelatin sheets in cold water and let soak for 10 minutes until soft.
    <li>Whip the 35% cream on 3rd speed to a medium wet stage and set aside.
    <li>Place the yolks and sugar into a mixing bowl. Whip on 3rd speed until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes.
    <li>Place the mango puree and gelatin sheets in a pot and bring to a boil.
    <li>Add the puree to the egg mixture on medium speed until blended. Let the mixture cool.

  </ol>
  <h3>Glaze</h3>

  <h3>Assembly</h3>
  <ol>

    <li>Place one piece of cake into the bottom of the ring. Fill the ring halfway with mousse.
    <li>Place 2nd layer of cake on top of mousse, press down gently. Fill the rest of the ring with mousse and level the mousse with a palette knife.
