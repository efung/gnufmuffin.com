Mango Mousse Cake
Yield: TWO 7" or 8" cakes

* Sponge Sheet

9 eggs
340 g sugar
360 g bread or all-purpose flour
10 mL vanilla extract

Line one baking sheet with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, whip the eggs, sugar and vanilla for 10-12 minutes on 3rd speed. Mix to a foamy thick texture. Sift the flour and fold in my hand. Spread the batter on the baking tray with an offset palette knife. Bake at 375F for 12-15 minutes until light golden.

* Mousse

940 mL 35% cream
6 egg yolks
170 g granulated sugar
465 mL mango puree
11 sheets gelatin

Place the gelatin sheets in cold water and let soak for 10 minutes until soft. Whip the 35% cream on 3rd speed to a medium wet stage and set aside. Place the yolks and sugar into a mixing bowl. Whip on 3rd speed until light and fluffy for 10 minutes. Place the mango puree and gelatin sheets in a pot and bring to a boil. Add the puree to the egg mixture on medium speed until blended. Let the mixture cool. Add a small amount of cream to the above, mix to temper by hand. Add the rest of the cream in stages, mix just until blended.

* Glaze

50 g mango puree
6 g gelatin leaves
60 g sugar
60 g hot water

Place the gelatin leaves in cold water until they are soft. Place mango puree, water and sugar into a pot and heat just until hot. Remove from heat. Add the gelatin and mix until blended. Let cool slightly before pouring on cake. Pour over the mango mousse carefully while the glaze is still warm to produce a shiny glaze. Once the glaze is set, decorate top of cake with fresh fruit.

* Assembly

Line two 7"- or 8" cake rings with acetate and place on cake board. Cut out 4 circles of cake 1/4" smaller than your cake ring (2 pieces per cake). Place one piece of cake into the bottom of the ring. Fill the ring halfway with mousse. Place 2nd layer of cake on top of mousse, press down gently. Fill the rest of the ring with mousse and level the mousse with a palette knife.
