<div class="recipe-summary">
This yogurt cheesecake has been in our family since I was a kid,
back when we used to make homemade yogurt. That machine is now long
gone, but we still make this cheesecake from time to time. The original
recipe came from the accompanying booklet.

What makes it stand out for me is that the yogurt provides additional 
tanginess, while also making the texture lighter.

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>First, make the crust: Preheat oven to 375&deg;F. Combine all ingredients and 
            press into bottom and sides of a 9 to 10" springform pan. Bake for 8 minutes.
            Lower oven to 350&deg;F.
    <li>Next, to make the filling, using an electric mixer, in large bowl, beat cream 
            cheese with sugar until smooth. 
    <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add yogurt 
            and extracts, if using, and beat until just incorporated.
    <li>Pour into prepared crust (through sieve if you see any lumps in the mixture).
            Bake for about 50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in center is mostly 
            clean, without any wetness.
    <li>Cool pan on rack for 15 minutes, then use a thin knife to loosen edges from pan.
            Let cool completely and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving.
