  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>Meringue Layers</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw six 7" circles on 2 pieces parchment paper.
    <li>Blend together the hazelnuts and cornstarch; set aside.
    <li>Whip egg whites to thick foam; slowly add the sugar and continue whipping
until the meringue forms stiff peaks.
    <li>Add the vanilla and mix until blended.
    <li>Fold in the nut mixture by hand.
    <li>Using a #6 plain piping tip, pipe the meringue in a spiral within the
circles drawn on the paper.
<li>Bake at 300&deg;F for 1 h 15 min until the meringue is dry. <strong>Note</strong>: Baking temp
can be reduced to 250-275&deg;F and baked longer to prevent meringues from forming
air pockets.
  </ol>
  <h3>Caramel</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the cream just until scalded; set aside.
    <li>Place sugar, water and glucose into a pot and cook on high heat to caramelize to a light golden colour.
    <li>Wash the sides of the pot down during the early stages of cooking.
    <li>Remove from heat.
    <li>Add the cream carefully (mixture will boil violently) in stages and mix until blended.
    <li>Add the butter and mix until blended.
    <li>Pour caramel into baking trays and place in the fridge until cool and starting to set.
  </ol>
  <h3>Cream</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak gelatin in a bowl of water until soft.
    <li>Remove from water and place in a pie plate with 40 grams of water; set aside.
    <li>Place cream and sugar (if using) in a mixing bowl and whip to medium firm peaks.
    <li>Heat the gelatin just until dissolved. Temper with some cream.
    <li>With the mixer running, add the gelatin mixture to the cream and continue whipping to firm peaks. Add quickly, or the gelatin will form lumps.
  </ol>
  <h3>Assembly</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of butterscotch on each layer of meringue.
    <li>Place one layer of meringue on the cake board.
    <li>Using a #9 plain piping tip, pipe a spiral of cream over the top of each meringue layer.
    <li>Stack the 2nd and 3rd layers of meringue on top of the 1st layer.
    <li>Using a paper cone, pipe the butterscotch on the top layer in a zig-zag pattern.
  </ol>
