Ruth, a fellow Canadian food blogger, is <a href="http://onceuponafeast.blogspot.com/2006/04/next-months-sugar-high-friday-ginger.html">hosting</a> this edition of <a href="http://domesticgoddess.ca/pages.php?page=10002">Sugar High Friday</a>, with a theme ingredient of <span style="font-weight:bold;">ginger</span>. I must admit that while I enjoy ginger in its many forms (tea, candied, freshly grated, powdered), I don't often seek out sweet recipes that use it. In fact, I often find myself throwing out a hunk of the fresh root when it has shrivelled up before I have a chance to use it. For this month's event, I bought a jar of <a href="http://www.gingerpeople.com/order_syrup.html">stem ginger in syrup</a> before I even knew what I was going to make!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/153850165/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/68/153850165_9340d2e504_m.jpg" class="inlineright" width="240" height="180" alt="Coffee and Walnut Cake (2)" /></a>My contribution comes from <span style="font-style:italic;">Desserts by Pierre Hermé</span> by Dorie Greenspan. I was foolish enough to attempt this recipe on a weeknight, knowing full well that most Hermé recipes have multiple components with complicated preparations. I started with the base: a brown sugar japonais, which is a meringue cake made with ground almonds and walnuts. To intensify their flavours, I gave the nuts a good toasting, then rubbed off their skins and ground them in a food processor. And since the recipe for the coffee cream used 4 egg yolks, and the cake calls for 3 whites, I added an extra white to the meringue. The brown sugar was difficult to push through the fine-mesh strainer I had so I didn't bother. After the batter was made up, I turned it into a cake ring placed on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Thirty minutes in the oven gave the top a nice brown colour and left the cake soft and spongey. I let that cool while I prepared the other components.<br /><br />My ginger in syrup came in little cubes so I wasn't sure how many I needed. The recipe says to cut enough paper-thin slices to cover the cake, so I just kept slicing until I filled a plate about the same size as the ring. The only thing to do for the jam (<a href="http://www.jacobfruitfield.com/brands/fruitfield/">coarse cut orange marmalade</a>) was to loosen it with a bit of water and heat it up briefly.<br /><br />The coffee <span style="font-style:italic;">crème anglaise</span> sounded simple enough but my troubles started here. Instead of using a cheesecloth like the directions suggested, I tried to be clever and strain the milk infusion in a single-cup coffee filter. The large quantity of ground coffee (&pound;2, instead of the called-for espresso grind) prevented the milk from dripping very quickly. As I stirred it around, I ended up tearing a hole in the paper so I had grounds in my cup! Next, I tried wringing the torn filter but that just made a bigger mess. Finally, I took <span style="font-style:italic;">another</span> filter and re-strained the infused milk, muttering all the while why the recipe couldn't be satisfied with using instant espresso powder alone. As I was heating the yolks, milk and sugar to make the custard, I dissolved some gelatin in cold water then put it in the microwave to melt it. Unfortunately, I heated it until it boiled but I let it cool down before mixing everything together for the coffee cream. After 10 minutes in the ice bath, it still hadn't thickened and I began to wonder whether the gelatin was setting properly. A quick search on Google suggested that the gelling power of gelatin is diminished if it is boiled. For insurance, I dissolved and melted some more gelatin (throwing in a pinch of instant espresso powder for good measure) and added that to the cream.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnuf/153850164/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/62/153850164_66898335f6_m.jpg" class="inlineleft" width="240" height="180" alt="Coffee and Walnut Cake (1)" /></a>For assembly, the japonais went in the bottom of the ring, followed by a layer of marmalade, a layer of sliced ginger, and the cream was poured over the top. It was quite runny and began to leak so I quickly put the whole thing in the refrigerator. The next morning, I discovered that the cream layer didn't set very firmly so it ended up like a thick sauce as it warmed to room temperature. I brushed the cake with a bit of melted jam and ginger syrup and garnished it with an orange <a title="or, my best guess at what one is supposed to look like">rosette</a>.<br /><br />At work, my tasters thought the combination was unusual but quite tasty. Each of the flavours was identifiable but I felt that a bit more ginger would have been nice, perhaps some ground ginger in the cake, or a knob of fresh ginger in the cream infusion.
