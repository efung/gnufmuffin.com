Brioche isn't good for you. With a flour-butter ratio of 2:1 or even
closer, and a healthy amount of eggs, it's an enriched bread that could 
easily pass as a pastry. After reading *Bouchon Bakery*'s recipe for
_craquelins_, a brioche made with orange and sugar, I knew I had to try
it.

*Sunday morning* I started by blanching the hollowed out shells of three
oranges.

I needed to go out, so a few hours later, I cut the halves into strips,
immersed them in heavy syrup and simmered them for just under an hour.
