If you're looking for a recipe that makes Belgian waffles (the kind
you top with fruit and cream), I found one. Not only did these turn
out soft and light, they're made with half whole wheat flour, so you
can pretend that you're having a healthy, whole-grain breakfast.

The
[recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/basic-waffle-recipe.html)
comes from Alton Brown and could not be simpler. You don't need to whip
the whites separately, nor do you need let it rise overnight. Just mix
the dry and wet ingredients separately, then together, and let it sit 
while you preheat the waffle iron.

I don't have a Belgian waffle iron (the round kind with thick holes),
just the standard rectangular one. My yield was twelve, rectangular
four-inch waffles. Will make this again, since my son asks for pancakes
or waffles every weekend!
