There's a lot more orange-fleshed squash than pumpkin out there.
[This page](https://www.chowhound.com/food-news/155277/get-to-know-these-11-winter-squashes-for-a-tasty-fall/)
lists a bunch of them. With hunks of leftover butternut and Kabocha squash 
in the fridge, I made this breakfast cake recipe to rave reviews.

The [recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/pumpkin-and-orange-breakfast-cake-with-a-fresh-orange-syrup-recipe-1956063) 
comes from my favourite baking book, [In The Sweet Kitchen](/tag/in-the-sweet-kitchen/). Instead
of buying boring pumpkin pur√©e, it's easy to just toss in a cut, seeded squash half
the next time you have a hot oven running. In about a half an hour, you'll be able
to scoop out the soft, roasted flesh.
