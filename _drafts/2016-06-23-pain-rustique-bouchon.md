Over the past two weeks, I've built up a _liquid levain_ (wet sourdough starter)
[again](/2015/05/walnut-batards.html) and went back to the bread recipes in
[Bouchon Bakery](/tag/bouchon-bakery/). This rustic loaf had great chew,
and a mild sour flavour.

I fed the starter twice daily for about a week, experimenting with various 
locations in my house: in the oven with the incandescent lamp on, a high
shelf in the warm, third floor attic, and on the kitchen counter. The
starter was quite active with bubbles, and by the end of the first week,
I started adjusting the temperature and water level to develop a more
sour flavour. 

From the Bouchon book, they suggest increasing the temperature and
decreasing the water. There were also a lot of tips from this
[article in Brød &
Taylor](http://brodandtaylor.com/make-sourdough-more-sour/), mainly,
fermenting at a warmer temperature (up to 29°C) and using some rye
flour. These are things I will have to try in the future.

The recipe for this 

Pressing into rectangle, careful not to degas, otherwise no big holes
Too much flour in brotform
transfer peel ideaa, use tension in linen
