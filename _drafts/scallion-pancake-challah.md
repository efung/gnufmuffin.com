A few weeks ago, Flick saw someone on her Facebook feed talking about a
&ldquo;Chinese challah&rdquo;. This set off alarm bells in my head, as
I often cringe when I hear a dish described as Asian-inspired, but I
turned up an interesting-sounding recipe for a bread laced with sesame
and scallions.

- Flick's Facebook mentioned
- Dug around, found Molly Yeh's recipe on MyJewishLearning
- Recipe isn't a good challah.
- Thought I might need to brown and caramelize green onions first
- This recipe does just one rise
- Fell asleep on Fri night, and let it rise a 2nd time in fridge.
- Next morning, shaped and braided and baked off right away.
- Texture wasn't as light, and it seemed weak, expanding outwards rather
  than upwards
