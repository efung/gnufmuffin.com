We went to [Andrews' Scenic Acres](http://www.andrewsscenicacres.com/) in Milton
on the weekend. Dr. S was sick at home, so I took my two kids and met up
with my parents, for a morning of strawberry, cherry, and raspberry picking.
I just got a new ice cream maker (the Breville one) that has a compressor,
so I was eager to try it out.
