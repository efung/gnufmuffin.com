These peanut-butter filled oatmeal sandwich cookies looked simple,
but this weekend project ended up being spread over three days.

The [recipe](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Better-Nutters)
comes from [Bouchon Bakery](/tag/Bouchon%20Bakery), and is the latest
stop in my random walk through the book. It's based on the [Nutter
Butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutter_Butter) which Wikipedia
tells me has been on the market for over 40 years. I've never had one
before, and don't plan to either.

There are three components to make: the buttercream, the filling, and
the cookie dough. Since the buttercream makes more than twice what's
needed in the filling, and it's hard to make a small batch of
buttercream, I doubled up on the cookies. The dough is extremely
soft and sticky when it's close to room temperature. After chilling the
completed dough, I needed to re-chill it after rolling it flat, since it
had gotten so sticky.

My schedule ended up as: 

- Saturday afternoon: make cookie dough, shape into flat square, chill
- Sunday: roll dough, chill, make buttercream, cut cookies out, chill
- Monday: bake off cookies, make filling, chill, pipe filling
