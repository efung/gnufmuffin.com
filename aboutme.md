This site began when I [wrote about](/gbc) taking baking classes at George Brown College.

My love of baking began as a little boy, helping my Mom in the kitchen.
Now, my son [likes to bake
too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfQJCSHVGo).

I try to never make the same thing twice.

I currently live in Toronto, Canada with my wife, son and daughter.

By day, I am a mobile developer at <a href="http://shopify.com/mobile">Shopify</a>. I've worked previously
at Zynga, Five Mobile, RIM and Certicom.
