This site began when I wrote about [taking baking classes](/gbc) at George Brown College.

My love of baking began as a little boy, helping my Mom in the kitchen.
Now, my son [likes to bake
too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfQJCSHVGo).

I try to never make the same thing twice. 

There are [{{ site.tags['muffins'].size }} posts](/tag/muffins) about muffins on this blog.

I currently live in Toronto, Canada with my wife, son and daughter.

By day, I am a mobile software developer at [Shopify](http://shopify.com/mobile)
in Toronto, Canada. I've worked previously at Zynga, Five Mobile, RIM and Certicom.
